# Earthback Docs — Phase 3

**Status:** Not started · Begins when the app reaches stable MVP usage

## What this is

The knowledge base — reduces support burden and helps groups self-serve.

## Planned tool

Docusaurus (or similar static docs site), deployed separately from the marketing site and app.

## Planned content

- [ ] Getting started guides (for group organizers, members, and admins)
- [ ] Group templates:
  - Build day
  - Food co-op
  - Training cohort
  - Mutual aid network
  - Water / infrastructure project
  - Community housing
- [ ] Safety & moderation policies (plain language)
- [ ] Trust & reputation explained
- [ ] FAQ
- [ ] Public roadmap

## Guiding principle

Docs should answer the question *"what do I do next?"* — not just describe features.
Write for people who are mid-project and stuck, not just for onboarding.
