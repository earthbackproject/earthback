## BUILDING & SHELTER

---

### hempcrete *(new circle — add to platform)*

**Post H-1** | `hempcrete` | ⏳ hold (hempcrete LoRA pending)
Hemp shiv mixed with lime binder doesn't just insulate — it mineralizes over decades. The lime slowly carbonates, locking CO₂ into the wall and turning soft plant material into something closer to stone. A hempcrete wall built today is still sequestering carbon 40 years from now. Most building materials work against the atmosphere. This one works with it.

**Post H-2** | `hempcrete` | ⏳ hold (hempcrete LoRA pending)
Hempcrete doesn't rot. That surprises people who hear "hemp" and think organic, biodegradable, impermanent. The mineral matrix — the lime — creates an alkaline environment that mold and insects can't survive in. The hemp itself becomes encased. Buildings from the 1980s in France still have their original hempcrete in perfect condition. Get the moisture management right and it outlasts you.

**Post H-3** | `hempcrete` | ⏳ hold (hempcrete LoRA pending)
The R-value of hempcrete (around R-2 per inch) sounds modest until you remember it also provides thermal mass, vapor regulation, and acoustic damping in the same material. You're not just buying insulation. A 12-inch hempcrete wall handles what would take four separate systems in a conventional build. That simplicity is where the real cost advantage lives.

### earth-building

**Post E-1** | `earth-building` | ✅ existing circle image
A compressed earth block made from subsoil, a small amount of stabilizer, and a mechanical press has a compressive strength of 2–4 MPa — comparable to many low-load masonry uses. The kicker: the soil often comes from the building site itself. Your foundation excavation becomes your wall material. No kiln, no firing, no shipping. The carbon footprint is essentially whatever diesel you put in the press.

**Post E-2** | `earth-building` | ✅ existing circle image
Adobe has been building continuously in New Mexico, Yemen, Mali, and Iran for thousands of years — not because people lacked options, but because it works. Thermal lag in a thick adobe wall means the heat peak that hits your exterior at noon doesn't reach the interior until evening, when outside temperatures are already dropping. The wall is doing passive climate control with no moving parts and no energy input.

---

### cob

**Post C-1** | `cob` | ✅ existing circle image
Cob is clay, sand, and straw mixed wet and built monolithically — no forms, no blocks, no mortar joints. The straw acts like rebar, tensioning the clay matrix from within. Mix ratios are tuned by feel: too much clay and it cracks, too much sand and it crumbles, too little straw and it has no tensile strength. Getting that feel is the whole skill. It takes a morning to learn and years to master.

**Post C-2** | `cob` | ✅ existing circle image
Cob is one of the most repairable building materials that exists. Damage to a cob wall gets fixed with more cob — same material, no special tools, no contractors. A crack from settling gets wet, packed, and smoothed. Cob builders talk about their walls as living things because in a real sense they are: the material stays responsive to moisture, which means it stays responsive to repair. That's a feature, not a bug.

### rammed-earth

**Post R-1** | `rammed-earth` | ✅ existing circle image
Rammed earth walls are essentially geology you made yourself. The visible strata — layers of different colored soil compacted in sequence — aren't decorative. They're structural records of how the wall was built, each lift slightly different in mineral composition. The compressive strength of well-rammed earth exceeds 3 MPa. That's strong enough for multi-story construction, and it looks like the land it came from.

**Post R-2** | `rammed-earth` | ✅ existing circle image
Thermal lag is the secret weapon of heavy earthen walls. A 400mm rammed earth wall has a time lag of roughly 10–12 hours — the heat that hits the outside face at noon arrives at the interior around midnight, when you're not trying to cool the house. That's passive temperature regulation that requires zero energy input, ever. The wall is doing the work of your HVAC on the days that matter most.

---

### straw-bale

**Post SB-1** | `straw-bale` | ✅ existing circle image
Straw bale walls consistently test at R-30 to R-35 depending on bale density and orientation — better than most code-minimum conventional walls in the US, which hover around R-20. That performance comes from compressed air pockets in the straw, not from petroleum-derived foam. The insulation is a byproduct of agriculture. Someone was going to burn or compost that straw either way.

**Post SB-2** | `straw-bale` | ✅ existing circle image
The straw bale fire myth is worth burying: loose straw burns fast, but a bale compressed tight enough to build with is oxygen-deprived at its core. Plastered straw bale walls have survived ASTM fire tests for over two hours. The real challenge with straw bale construction isn't fire — it's moisture management. Keep the bales dry during construction, seal the plaster well, and you have a wall that lasts for generations.

### stone-masonry

**Post SM-1** | `stone-masonry` | ✅ existing circle image
Dry-stack stone walls require no mortar, no cement, and no energy input beyond human labor. They're also fully reversible — every stone can be reclaimed and used again. Walls built this way in the British Isles have been standing since the Iron Age, not because stone is indestructible but because dry-stack allows for micro-movement. The wall breathes, flexes slightly with frost and settle, and keeps going. Rigid mortared joints crack. The flexible ones don't.

**Post SM-2** | `stone-masonry` | ✅ existing circle image
When you build with local stone, the embodied transportation energy is essentially zero. Compare that to steel (shipped globally from a handful of production centers), concrete block (regionally manufactured but still energy-intensive), or any cladding product (often traveling thousands of miles). Stone from your land, laid by hand, has one of the lowest full-lifecycle carbon profiles of any structural wall system. It also looks like it belongs there, because it does.

### timber-framing

**Post TF-1** | `timber-framing` | ✅ existing circle image
A mortise-and-tenon joint pegged with a hardwood dowel has been holding timber frames together for over a thousand years in Japan, England, and Scandinavia. Modern metal connectors fail by corrosion or fatigue. The peg joint fails by compression of the wood grain — very slowly, very visibly, always with warning. Traditional joinery is built to tell you when it's tired. That's a design philosophy, not just a technique.

**Post TF-2** | `timber-framing` | 🆕 needs: timber frame with hempcrete or straw infill panels, natural light
A timber frame is a skeleton that can be filled with almost anything: straw bales, hempcrete, cob, natural insulation board, even wattle and daub. The structural load goes through the frame, so the infill only needs to handle weather and insulation. This is where timber framing and natural building converge — you get the precision and structural confidence of the frame and the thermal performance of whatever natural material makes sense for your climate.

### bamboo

**Post B-1** | `bamboo` | ✅ existing circle image
Bamboo is the fastest-growing structural material on earth. Some species gain a meter a day during peak growth season. A bamboo grove can be harvested on a 4–7 year rotation without replanting. For comparison, structural timber from temperate forests takes 40–80 years to grow. That rotation difference — 6 years versus 60 — changes every calculation about sustainable building supply, especially in tropical regions where bamboo already grows.

**Post B-2** | `bamboo` | ✅ existing circle image
Untreated bamboo exposed to moisture and insects can degrade in 2–3 years. Properly treated bamboo lasts 25+ years with the same visual character. The treatment doesn't require industrial chemicals — traditional methods use borax solution, smoke, or oil immersion. The material isn't fragile; it just needs to be handled right. Most bamboo construction failures trace to skipping this step, not to any inherent weakness in the material.

### living-roofs

**Post LR-1** | `living-roofs` | ✅ existing circle image
A sedum living roof retains 40–90% of annual rainfall depending on growing medium depth and plant density. That water either slowly evaporates back into the atmosphere or drains gently over many hours — instead of spiking the stormwater system all at once. In urban areas, that retention difference is meaningful at scale. In rural builds, it means your roof is also your first-stage rainwater catchment and your biggest thermal buffer in one installation.

**Post LR-2** | `living-roofs` | ✅ existing circle image
Living roofs insulate differently than conventional roofs — the thermal mass of saturated growing medium stabilizes temperature swings rather than resisting them. A dry sedum roof on a hot day reflects solar gain and insulates modestly. A wet sedum roof uses that moisture to buffer temperature through evaporative cooling. The roof performs better exactly when you need it most: after rain, during heat events. That's the opposite of most building materials, which degrade under stress.

---

### natural-plasters

**Post NP-1** | `natural-plasters` | ✅ existing circle image
Lime plaster is a vapor-open finish — it lets moisture pass through the wall rather than trapping it inside. That breathability is why lime has coexisted with earthen and straw construction for millennia. Cement plaster over an earthen wall doesn't breathe; it traps moisture that then cycles between the plaster and the wall, damaging both. The choice of finish coat isn't aesthetic first. It's a moisture management decision that affects everything behind it.

**Post NP-2** | `natural-plasters` | ✅ existing circle image
Lime carbonates as it cures — absorbing CO₂ from the atmosphere to harden. The lime used in the plaster was originally made by heating limestone (releasing CO₂), so carbonation is partly recapturing what was emitted in production. Over a 25-year lifespan, a lime-plastered wall absorbs roughly 25% of its production emissions back. No other common finish material does this. The wall is still working after you've moved in.

### passive-solar

**Post PS-1** | `passive-solar` | ✅ existing circle image
The rule of thumb for passive solar: south-facing glazing area should be 7–12% of your conditioned floor area, with thermal mass (tile, concrete, earthen floor) equal to 3–6 times that glazing area. Too much glass without enough mass and you get overheating. Too much mass without enough glass and you lose the effect. The balance is the design — and it requires no fuel to run, ever, for the life of the building.

**Post PS-2** | `passive-solar` | 🆕 needs: deep south-facing window with overhangs, raking winter sun, thermal mass floor visible
Overhangs are passive solar's second system. A properly calculated overhang — sized by latitude — shades the south glazing completely in summer when the sun is high and allows full penetration in winter when the sun is low. In the American Southwest at 35° latitude, a 24-inch overhang over a 4-foot window does exactly this. No moving parts, no sensors, no controls. The geometry does the work.

## ENERGY

### solar-electric

**Post SE-1** | `solar-electric` | ✅ existing circle image
Off-grid battery sizing is a math problem most people get wrong because they calculate for average use, not worst-case days. The right question isn't "how much power do I use per day?" — it's "how many consecutive cloudy days can I survive, and at what reduced consumption?" A properly sized off-grid system is designed for the third-worst week of the year in your climate, not the average week. That design conservatism is what keeps the lights on in February.

**Post SE-2** | `solar-electric` | ✅ existing circle image
Grid-tied solar with net metering and off-grid solar with batteries are solving different problems. Grid-tied reduces your bill and carbon footprint; it doesn't keep your lights on when the grid goes down. Off-grid gives you true energy independence but requires battery infrastructure that costs more and degrades over time. A third option — grid-tied with battery backup — gives you resilience without full off-grid sizing. Which one is right depends entirely on why you're installing solar.

### rocket-stove

**Post RS-1** | `rocket-stove` | ✅ existing circle image
A rocket stove's efficiency comes from one design principle: complete combustion before heat extraction. The insulated L-shaped combustion chamber gets so hot that unburned gases ignite on their way up. Conventional wood stoves extract heat early, which cools the gases and leaves particulates unburned. Rocket stoves run at 80–90% efficiency vs. 50–70% for conventional stoves — and produce almost no visible smoke, which is both an air quality benefit and a sign that the wood is fully combusted.

**Post RS-2** | `rocket-stove` | ✅ existing circle image
A rocket mass heater burns roughly 80–90% less wood than a conventional stove to heat the same space. The combustion gases pass through a long horizontal thermal mass bench before exhausting — the bench absorbs and stores heat, then radiates it slowly for 12–18 hours after the fire is out. You fire it once in the morning, let the bench absorb the heat, and the room stays warm all day. Small-diameter wood — the stuff that falls naturally in any managed woodlot — is the fuel. No cord wood splitting required.

---

### solar-thermal

**Post STH-1** | `solar-electric` | 🆕 needs: flat plate solar collector on roof, copper pipes, detail shot
Solar thermal (water heating) is the highest-ROI solar application most people never consider. A solar hot water system converts 50–70% of incoming solar energy into usable heat. PV panels convert 18–22%. For water heating specifically, solar thermal is 2–3× more efficient per square meter than PV. It's not the right answer for everything, but if hot water is your biggest energy draw — which it is for most households — the math is hard to argue with.

**Post STH-2** | `solar-electric` | ✅ existing circle image
Breadbox solar water heaters — a tank inside an insulated, glazed box — have no pumps, no controls, no moving parts. They preheat water passively before it enters a conventional water heater, typically cutting water heating energy use by 40–60% in sunny climates. The design is older than photovoltaics and simpler than a bicycle. Communities building with limited budgets often get more value from a $200 breadbox heater than from any PV panel at 10× the cost.

### biochar

**Post BC-1** | `biochar` | ✅ existing circle image
Biochar is carbon that has been stabilized into a form that resists decomposition for hundreds to thousands of years. When you burn woody material in a low-oxygen environment (pyrolysis), instead of releasing all that carbon as CO₂, you trap roughly half of it as a solid. Bury it in your soil and that carbon stays sequestered. Agriculture and forestry waste that would otherwise rot or burn becomes a permanent carbon sink and a soil amendment in one step.

**Post BC-2** | `biochar` | ✅ existing circle image
Biochar doesn't feed plants directly — it feeds the microbial community that feeds plants. Its highly porous structure (a single gram has the surface area of a tennis court) creates habitat for beneficial microbes and holds water and nutrients that would otherwise leach past the root zone. Mixing biochar with compost before application — "charging" it — dramatically outperforms either input alone. The biochar is infrastructure for your soil biology, not fertilizer.

### wind-power

**Post WP-1** | `wind-power` | ✅ existing circle image
Small wind turbines under 10kW are most useful as part of a hybrid system, not as a standalone power source. Wind and solar are naturally complementary in many climates — cloudy days with storms often bring wind; calm, clear days favor solar. A hybrid system with modest battery storage can achieve more consistent output than either source alone. The sizing math is different from pure solar; you're now modeling two intermittent inputs and their correlation over your specific site.

**Post WP-2** | `wind-power` | ✅ existing circle image
Site assessment is make-or-break for small wind. Average wind speed below about 5 m/s at hub height makes a turbine economically marginal. Before buying hardware, spend a season logging actual wind data at your site at the height you plan to mount. Nearby tree height, terrain features, and local weather patterns all matter. A turbine installed in the wrong spot can underperform by 50% or more versus its rated output. The data costs nothing. The hardware costs a lot.

---

### micro-hydro

**Post MH-1** | `micro-hydro` | ✅ existing circle image
Micro-hydro is the most underrated off-grid power source in wet climates. A stream dropping 10 meters with a flow of just 2 liters per second generates roughly 150 watts — continuous, 24/7, regardless of weather. That 24/7 continuity is what makes it so valuable: 150 watts of micro-hydro is worth far more in a real off-grid system than 1,000 watts of solar, because the solar delivers nothing at night and little on cloudy days. If you have the head and flow, micro-hydro changes the entire system design.

**Post MH-2** | `micro-hydro` | ✅ existing circle image
The Pelton wheel — the classic micro-hydro turbine — has been in continuous use since 1879 with essentially no design changes. A brass Pelton bucket is nearly indestructible under normal operating conditions. The main maintenance points are the intake screen (clear debris), the nozzle (replace every 5–10 years), and the bearings (lubricate annually). A well-installed micro-hydro system run from a clean mountain stream can operate for 30 years with minimal intervention. That reliability has no solar equivalent.

### biogas

**Post BG-1** | `biogas` | ✅ existing circle image
A household-scale biogas digester converts food scraps, manure, and organic waste into methane gas for cooking and the spent slurry into nutrient-rich fertilizer. A digester fed with the manure from two cows can produce enough gas to cook three meals a day for a family. The system closes a loop that most households leave open: organic waste that would otherwise pollute water or emit methane untapped becomes the fuel that heats the kitchen, and the byproduct feeds the garden.

**Post BG-2** | `biogas` | ✅ existing circle image
Biogas digesters work best in warm climates but function in cold ones with insulation and sometimes supplemental heating. The key variable is temperature: methanogens (the microbes producing the gas) work optimally at 35°C. Below 20°C production slows dramatically. In cold climates, burying the digester underground, insulating it, and sometimes running a small heat exchanger from another heat source keeps temperatures in the productive range year-round. The biology is delicate; the engineering to protect it is not.

## FOOD & GROWING

### permaculture

**Post P-1** | `permaculture` | ✅ existing circle image
Permaculture's zone system isn't about ideology — it's about energy. Zone 1 (kitchen garden, herb bed) needs daily attention, so it goes closest to the house. Zone 5 (rewilded land, minimal intervention) needs none, so it goes furthest. Every step you take to tend something costs energy; placing high-maintenance elements close reduces the cost of caring for them. It sounds obvious. Most land design ignores it completely.

**Post P-2** | `permaculture` | ✅ existing circle image
A guild is a group of plants that support each other — one fixes nitrogen, one accumulates deep minerals, one provides ground cover, one attracts pollinators, one repels pests. The classic "three sisters" (corn, beans, squash) is a guild. A well-designed permaculture guild does the work of fertilizer, pest control, and weed suppression simultaneously, with no inputs beyond the initial planting. The complexity isn't the point; the reduced labor over time is.

---

### food-forest

**Post FF-1** | `food-forest` | ✅ existing circle image
A food forest mimics the structure of a woodland — canopy trees, understory trees, shrubs, ground cover, root crops, vines, and fungi — but every layer is edible or functional. Once established (3–7 years depending on climate), a food forest produces food with minimal labor. The system becomes increasingly self-maintaining: the leaf litter mulches itself, the nitrogen fixers feed the fruiting trees, the ground cover suppresses weeds. You're building an ecosystem that feeds people rather than one you manage against.

**Post FF-2** | `food-forest` | ✅ existing circle image
Canopy selection is the most consequential decision in a food forest design because canopy trees define everything below them — light levels, root competition, microclimate, longevity. A walnut canopy (allelopathic to many plants, very long-lived) creates different design constraints than an apple canopy (less competitive, earlier production, shorter lifespan). Design your canopy for 50 years, not for the first harvest. Most food forest failures trace to canopy trees that weren't right for the site from the start.

### mushroom-cultivation

**Post MC-1** | `mushroom-cultivation` | ✅ existing circle image
Oyster mushrooms can fruit on cardboard, coffee grounds, straw, sawdust, or agricultural waste — almost any cellulosic material that would otherwise go to compost or landfill. The spawn inoculates the substrate, the mycelium colonizes it over 2–4 weeks, and then fruiting is triggered by dropping temperature and increasing fresh air exchange. First flush comes in 5–7 days after pinning. A single 5-pound straw block can produce 1–2 pounds of mushrooms across three flushes. That's food from waste, on a kitchen counter, in 30 days.

**Post MC-2** | `mushroom-cultivation` | ✅ existing circle image
Shiitake on logs is slow cultivation but produces for years. An inoculated oak log takes 6–18 months to fully colonize, then can be fruited by soaking in cold water (shocking the mycelium into producing). Once established, a single log fruits 2–3 times per year for 3–5 years. The log you're using is a 5-year investment. That time horizon changes how you think about mushroom growing — it's not a batch crop, it's a managed resource.

---

### composting

**Post CO-1** | `composting` | ✅ existing circle image
Hot compost needs a carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of roughly 25–30:1. Too much nitrogen (food scraps, manure, green material) and the pile goes anaerobic and smells. Too much carbon (dry leaves, straw, wood chips) and it just sits there, decomposing slowly. The right mix generates internal heat — a hot pile can reach 60°C at its core, which kills weed seeds and pathogens. Getting the ratio right isn't chemistry class; it's roughly alternating equal volumes of "green" (wet, nitrogen-rich) with "brown" (dry, carbon-rich) material.

**Post CO-2** | `composting` | ✅ existing circle image
Mature compost contains billions of microorganisms per gram — bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes. When you add compost to soil, you're not just adding organic matter; you're inoculating the soil with a working microbial community. That community suppresses pathogens, cycles nutrients, and builds aggregates that give soil its structure. Bagged synthetic fertilizer bypasses this system entirely. Compost builds the system itself. One grows a crop; the other grows the capacity to grow crops indefinitely.

---

### rainwater-harvesting

**Post RH-1** | `rainwater-harvesting` | ✅ existing circle image
Rainwater catchment math is straightforward: roof area (m²) × annual rainfall (mm) × 0.85 efficiency factor = liters of harvestable water per year. A 100m² roof in a climate getting 600mm of annual rain can harvest roughly 51,000 liters — about 140 liters per day averaged across the year. In most climates, that's enough for all non-potable household uses. The calculation is simple. The infrastructure to store it — cisterns, filtration, first-flush diverters — is where the design work lives.

**Post RH-2** | `rainwater-harvesting` | ✅ existing circle image
First-flush diverters are the least glamorous and most important component of a rainwater system. The first flow off any roof after dry weather carries concentrated dust, bird droppings, decomposed organic matter, and whatever else settled on the surface. A first-flush diverter fills a small bypass pipe with this contaminated first flow, then diverts cleaner water into the cistern. Without one, you're concentrating every contaminant from every dry spell into your drinking water. A $20 piece of PVC makes the difference.

---

### rewilding

**Post RW-1** | `rewilding` | ✅ existing circle image
Rewilding isn't the absence of management — it's shifting from control to facilitation. You remove the pressures that prevented succession (grazing, mowing, drainage), introduce keystone species that do the ecological work (native grasses, nitrogen-fixing shrubs, pollinators), and then step back. The system does the rest faster than most people expect. A former intensively farmed field can develop complex plant communities, insect diversity, and bird populations within 3–5 years of low-intervention restoration.

**Post RW-2** | `rewilding` | ✅ existing circle image
Soil carbon in rewilded land accumulates fastest in the first 5–10 years after restoration, as plant root networks expand and microbial communities rebuild. Measurements from rewilded grasslands in temperate regions show 0.3–0.5 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent sequestered per hectare per year during active restoration phases. That's not a climate solution at global scale — but on the land you're working, it's real, measurable, and permanent as long as the land stays undisturbed.

---

### community-land

**Post CL-1** | `community-land` | ✅ existing circle image
A community land trust permanently removes land from the speculative market by holding title in a nonprofit structure while granting long-term ground leases to homeowners and community users. The land can never be sold for profit; it stays affordable in perpetuity. There are over 300 CLTs in the United States, and the model has spread to the UK, Belgium, Kenya, and Australia. It's not a utopian experiment — it's a proven legal structure for keeping land accessible to the people who actually live and work on it.

**Post CL-2** | `community-land` | ✅ existing circle image
Shared ownership of land changes what's possible on it. A single homeowner building with experimental natural materials faces skepticism, permit challenges, and financing barriers alone. The same build, undertaken by a community land trust or intentional community with shared infrastructure, legal support, and collective knowledge, is suddenly mainstream. The land model and the building method reinforce each other. This is why so many of the most interesting natural building projects in the world happen on collectively held land.

---

### urban-farming

**Post UF-1** | `urban-farming` | ✅ existing circle image
A quarter-acre urban lot — managed intensively with permanent raised beds, no-till methods, and succession planting — can produce 3,000–6,000 pounds of food per year. That's enough calories to partially feed 4–6 people from what most cities zone as a single-family residential plot. Urban farming at this scale requires skill and attention but not large machinery, not large capital, and not large land. The limiting factors are knowledge and consistent labor, both of which communities can share.

**Post UF-2** | `urban-farming` | ✅ existing circle image
Vacant lot agriculture is one of the fastest paths from blight to community resource that exists. Remediation of mild contamination (the main concern on former urban lots) takes 1–3 seasons of cover cropping and soil amendment before food production. In the meantime, the visual presence of a cared-for lot changes the block. The food is valuable. The visibility of people working the soil is more valuable. Urban farming is community organizing with a harvest.

### herbalism

**Post HB-1** | `herbalism` | ✅ existing circle image
Most of the world's population still relies on plant medicine as primary or complementary healthcare — not from lack of access to pharmaceuticals, but from centuries of accumulated knowledge about what works. The World Health Organization estimates 80% of the world's population uses herbal medicine in some form. The plants themselves are often local, seasonal, and free. Learning which ones grow in your bioregion, what they're used for, and how to prepare them is one of the most practical things any community can invest time in.

**Post HB-2** | `herbalism` | ✅ existing circle image
Tinctures, the most common form of herbal medicine preparation, are simple: plant material macerated in alcohol (or glycerin for alcohol-free versions) for 4–6 weeks, then strained and bottled. The alcohol extracts and preserves a wide range of medicinal compounds. Shelf life is 3–5 years. A small herb garden — calendula, echinacea, elderberry, skullcap, lemon balm — can supply a household's basic herbal medicine cabinet with a few afternoons of processing per year. The knowledge gap is the barrier, not the difficulty.

### appropriate-tech

**Post AT-1** | `appropriate-tech` | ✅ existing circle image
E.F. Schumacher's definition of appropriate technology: tools and systems that are small enough to understand, cheap enough to own, and simple enough to repair. Not primitive — appropriate. A bicycle-powered grain mill is appropriate technology. A 50-ton industrial combine is not appropriate for a 2-acre homestead. The question isn't what's most efficient at scale; it's what's most effective at the scale you're actually working at, with the resources you actually have.

**Post AT-2** | `appropriate-tech` | ✅ existing circle image
The most appropriate technology for any given situation is usually the one that can be maintained locally, with locally available skills and parts. A solar panel is appropriate in most contexts; a solar panel with a proprietary inverter requiring factory-only firmware updates is less appropriate. The technology choices that build resilient communities are the ones that keep the repair capacity inside the community. Dependency on distant technical infrastructure is a form of fragility that shows up most when you can least afford it.

---

### tool-library

**Post TL-1** | `tool-library` | ✅ existing circle image
A tool library serving 500 households can replace 400+ individually owned sets of infrequently used tools — post-hole diggers, tile saws, cement mixers, scaffolding. The tools get used more (better economics per tool), maintained by people who know them (better outcomes), and don't take up garage space in hundreds of homes (less waste). The library of things model works for tools for the same reason it works for books: most of what you need, you only need occasionally. Ownership is the wrong model for occasional use.

**Post TL-2** | `tool-library` | ✅ existing circle image
Starting a neighborhood tool library doesn't require a building. A shared spreadsheet, a group chat, a $0 budget, and 10 households agreeing to share their underused tools is a functional library. The formalization comes later — booking systems, insurance, a physical location — but the core value is neighbor-to-neighbor trust and shared access. Many of the most durable tool libraries started as someone posting "I have a tile saw, who wants access?" The infrastructure follows when the community exists.

### repair-culture

**Post RC-1** | `repair-culture` | ✅ existing circle image
The European Union's Right to Repair directive now requires manufacturers to make spare parts and repair manuals available for most electronics and appliances for at least 7–10 years after production ends. This is policy catching up to a practice that communities and repair cafes have been sustaining for decades. The right to repair isn't just about saving money — it's about who controls the lifespan of the tools you depend on. Right now, that's mostly manufacturers. It doesn't have to be.

**Post RC-2** | `repair-culture` | ✅ existing circle image
A repair cafe — a regular community event where people bring broken things and skilled volunteers help fix them — diverts hundreds of items per event from the waste stream. The Amsterdam model, which started in 2009, now has over 2,500 affiliated cafes worldwide. The format is simple: a space, some tools, volunteers with skills in sewing, electronics, woodwork, and mechanical repair, and a steady stream of people who'd rather fix than replace. The community that forms around the repair table is often as valuable as the repairs themselves.

### seed-saving

**Post SS-1** | `seed-saving` | ✅ existing circle image
Open-pollinated varieties breed true — save seed from a well-adapted plant and the next generation has the same characteristics. Hybrid varieties (F1) don't: saving seed from a hybrid gives you unpredictable offspring that usually revert toward the parent lines. Seed saving is only practically possible with open-pollinated or heirloom varieties. This is why industrial agriculture's move toward hybrids — requiring fresh seed purchase every year — systematically eroded the seed-saving culture that sustained agriculture for 10,000 years.

**Post SS-2** | `seed-saving` | ✅ existing circle image
A seed library is one of the most durable community infrastructure investments that exists. Seeds stored dry and cool (below 50°F, below 50% humidity) remain viable for years — some varieties for decades. A community seed library doesn't need refrigeration or special equipment to get started; a cool, dry room and sealed envelopes work fine for most vegetables. What it requires is the human network: people growing the varieties, selecting for local conditions, and bringing seed back each season. The seeds are only as alive as the practice around them.
