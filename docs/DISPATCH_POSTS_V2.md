## WATER (remaining)

### greywater

**Post GW-1** | `greywater` | ✅ existing circle image
Greywater — water from sinks, showers, and laundry — makes up roughly 65% of household wastewater. It's not sewage. In most temperate climates, it contains enough nutrients and organic matter to feed landscape plants without any treatment beyond a simple mulch basin. A branched drain system distributes laundry water directly to shrubs and trees, requires no pumps or electricity, and costs less than $200 to install. Most jurisdictions allow it for subsurface irrigation. Check your local code, then stop sending perfectly good water to the sewage plant.

**Post GW-2** | `greywater` | ✅ existing circle image
The most common greywater system failure isn't clogged pipes — it's plant toxicity from high-sodium laundry detergents. Conventional laundry detergent contains sodium-based surfactants that build up in soil and degrade its structure over time. The fix is simple: switch to sodium-free soap (plant-based castile soap, or laundry products specifically labeled greywater-safe). That one product swap makes the difference between a greywater system that kills your soil and one that builds it. Your soap choice is a landscape design decision.

### water-harvesting

**Post WH-1** | `water-harvesting` | ✅ existing circle image
A swale is a level trench dug on contour across a slope. When it rains, runoff collects in the swale instead of flowing downhill, giving it time to infiltrate. The berm on the downslope side is planted with trees and shrubs whose roots access the stored moisture. Over time, the swale becomes a linear food forest — each one adding land productivity where there was previously just erosion. The design cost is zero if you understand your contour lines. The water is already falling; you're just deciding where it goes.

**Post WH-2** | `water-harvesting` | ✅ existing circle image
Brad Lancaster's rule of thumb for earthworks: start with the smallest intervention that captures the most water, highest on the landscape, and work your way down. That means micro-swales and rock mulch before you excavate ponds. Every small intervention slows runoff and increases infiltration, which changes what's possible for the interventions below it. This sequencing principle — slow, spread, sink before you store — shapes every decision about earthworks on a site and keeps you from building infrastructure that works against itself.

## FIBER & CRAFT

---

### natural-dyeing

**Post ND-1** | `natural-dyeing` | ✅ existing circle image
Mordanting — treating fiber with a mineral salt before dyeing — is what makes natural dye permanent. Without a mordant, most plant dyes wash out within a few cycles. Alum (aluminum sulfate) is the most common mordant: non-toxic, widely available, and compatible with most dye plants. Iron mordant shifts colors toward gray-green and "saddens" hues. Copper brightens them. The mordant is not the dye — it's the chemical bridge between the dye molecule and the fiber. Understanding mordants turns a hit-or-miss craft into a reproducible process.

**Post ND-2** | `natural-dyeing` | ✅ existing circle image
Indigo fermentation vats are one of the most distinctive processes in natural craft. Indigo pigment is insoluble in water — it won't dye anything in its raw form. A fermentation vat creates an alkaline, oxygen-depleted environment that converts indigo to its soluble "leuco" form. You dip the fiber, pull it out, and watch it turn from yellow-green to blue as it oxidizes in the air. The color isn't in the vat — it forms on the fiber as it meets oxygen. Every serious natural dyer maintains a living indigo vat the way a baker maintains a sourdough starter.

### weaving

**Post WV-1** | `weaving` | ✅ existing circle image
Every woven fabric is the intersection of two thread systems: the warp (set on the loom under tension before weaving begins) and the weft (passed through the warp on a shuttle). The warp determines the structure and length of the cloth. The weft determines the pattern, texture, and width. The relationship between them — how often the weft goes over or under each warp thread — is called the weave structure, and it determines everything: drape, durability, stretch, appearance. Plain weave, twill, satin, and tapestry are not aesthetic choices first. They're structural engineering.

**Post WV-2** | `weaving` | ✅ existing circle image
Traditional weaving communities developed their patterns as information systems — recording kinship, status, territory, cosmology, and seasonal knowledge in cloth that traveled with the wearer. Andean textiles, West African kente, Japanese kasuri, and Scandinavian folk weaving each encode regional knowledge in their pattern grammar. Learning to read a textile tradition is learning to read a compressed archive of how a community understood itself and its world. That knowledge is worth preserving with more urgency than most people realize — the weavers who hold it are not being replaced.

### basketry

**Post BK-1** | `basketry` | ✅ existing circle image
A well-made basket uses only the material it needs. There's no joining compound, no fastener, no filler. Every strand is structural. The tension of one element against another is what holds the form — coiling uses wrapped bundles; plaiting uses interlaced flat strips; twining uses twisted pairs of weavers that grip the stakes between them. The craft is essentially the same across every traditional culture that developed it independently: take a flexible long material and organize it against a rigid short material until the tension creates a container. Simple principle. Infinite variation.

**Post BK-2** | `basketry` | ✅ existing circle image
Sourcing your own basketry material changes the practice entirely. Black ash for Northeast American splint baskets, willow for British and European stake-and-strand, longleaf pine needles for Southern coiling, cattail for Midwestern plaiting — every bioregion has its traditional basketry materials, and most of them can still be harvested from healthy populations. Managing a small willow coppice or cattail marsh for basketry creates a relationship with land that intensifies your attention to seasonal cycles, plant health, and long-term succession. The basket becomes a record of the place it came from.

### pottery-ceramics

**Post PT-1** | `pottery-ceramics` | ✅ existing circle image
Clay is the decomposed residue of feldspathic rock — essentially ancient geology made plastic by water. What we call "throwing" is the manipulation of a clay body on a spinning wheel: centrifugal force opens the mass, and the hands compress and thin the walls from inside and outside simultaneously. The moment the clay dries to leather-hard, the walls become rigid enough to trim but not yet fired. Then bisque firing drives out all remaining moisture and organic matter. Then glaze, then high fire. The finished pot has passed through more distinct states of matter than almost any other object in everyday life.

**Post PT-2** | `pottery-ceramics` | ✅ existing circle image
Wood firing produces results that gas and electric kilns can't replicate. Flame and ash interact directly with the clay surface during long, high-temperature firings in anagama or noborigama kilns — natural ash deposits melt onto surfaces, creating glaze effects that couldn't be planned. The unpredictability is the point. A wood firing is a collaboration between the potter, the fuel, the kiln's draft, the weather, and the position of each piece in the chamber. Communities of potters often fire together because loading, stoking, and attending a 72-hour firing requires multiple people and generates more meaning than any individual studio process.

### blacksmithing

**Post BS-1** | `blacksmithing` | ✅ existing circle image
Steel is iron with a small percentage of carbon — typically 0.2% to 1.5%. Too little carbon and the metal is soft, won't hold an edge, and can't be hardened. Too much and it becomes brittle. Traditional blacksmiths developed intuition for carbon content by watching color during heating — each color from black heat to white heat corresponds to a temperature range, and the temperature at which you work determines what's possible. This color-temperature-carbon relationship is the core literacy of the craft. Modern metallurgy quantified it; smiths were working with it empirically for thousands of years before that.

**Post BS-2** | `blacksmithing` | ✅ existing circle image
A functioning forge, anvil, and set of hammers can produce almost every tool and fastener a natural building project needs — hinges, hooks, bolts, brackets, door hardware, garden tools, wood-splitting wedges, chisels. Community blacksmiths historically supplied all of these. A well-maintained anvil lasts centuries; a traditional coal or propane forge can be built from basic materials. The barrier to entry for community-scale blacksmithing is mostly knowledge, not equipment cost — the knowledge is well-documented and increasingly taught again as repair culture revives the craft.

## FOOD & GROWING (remaining)

### market-gardening

**Post MG-1** | `market-gardening` | ✅ existing circle image
Permanent raised beds on a no-till market garden don't get walked on. That single rule — no foot traffic on the growing surface — preserves the soil structure that makes intensive production possible. Compacted soil loses pore space; pore space is where oxygen, water, and roots live. On a permanent bed system, the soil never resets to compacted baseline. After 3-5 years of adding organic matter without tillage, a well-managed bed has structure that no amount of rototilling could replicate. The bed is the long-term investment; everything grown in it is interest.

**Post MG-2** | `market-gardening` | ✅ existing circle image
Succession planting turns a 4-foot bed into a year-round production unit. Radishes finish in 25 days — sow a new bed every two weeks and you have continuous harvest. Lettuce bolts in heat — transplant cold-weather varieties in fall and spring, direct sow heat-tolerant varieties for summer. Every time a crop finishes, the bed gets a thin layer of compost and a new transplant or direct seeding within 24 hours. Bare soil is a missed production window. The best market gardeners think of their beds as production schedules, not growing spaces.

---

### microgreens

**Post MG2-1** | `microgreens` | ✅ existing circle image
Microgreens are harvested at the cotyledon stage — 7 to 14 days after germination depending on species. At that stage, studies have found concentrations of certain vitamins and phytonutrients 4 to 40 times higher than in mature plants of the same species. This isn't marketing; it's because the seedling is mobilizing its full nutrient reserves from the seed to fuel early growth. You're harvesting at the moment of maximum nutritional density. The tradeoff is yield: microgreens produce grams per tray, not pounds per bed. They're a supplement to diverse growing, not a replacement for it.

**Post MG2-2** | `microgreens` | ✅ existing circle image
The two variables that separate mediocre microgreens from excellent ones are blackout time and air circulation. During the first 3-5 days, keeping trays in darkness and under weight (a heavy tray on top) drives etiolation — the seedlings stretch toward where they expect light to be, producing long, tender stems. Then full light triggers chlorophyll development and rapid leaf expansion. After trays come into light, air circulation prevents damping off, which is the main failure mode — a fungal collapse that takes out a tray overnight. A small fan running continuously is the difference between a 95% and a 50% success rate.

---

### aquaponics

**Post AQ-1** | `aquaponics` | ✅ existing circle image
Aquaponics closes a nutrient loop: fish produce ammonia-rich waste, bacteria convert it first to nitrite and then to nitrate, plants uptake the nitrate as fertilizer and clean the water, which returns to the fish. The bacterial colony — the nitrifying biofilm — is what makes the system work. It grows on any surface (grow bed media, filter material, tank walls) and takes 4-6 weeks to establish from scratch. Before the colony is mature, the system is in "cycling" mode and fish waste accumulates faster than it's processed. Most aquaponics failures happen in the first 6 weeks because the grower doesn't understand what's being waited for.

**Post AQ-2** | `aquaponics` | ✅ existing circle image
The raft (DWC) and media bed are the two dominant small-scale aquaponics designs. Raft systems float styrofoam panels with plant net cups directly over fish effluent — simple, high plant density, great for leafy greens. Media bed systems fill a raised bed with expanded clay or gravel, flood and drain it with fish water — more complex, but handles fruiting plants (tomatoes, peppers) better because roots have physical support. Many mature systems combine both: raft for greens, media bed for fruiting crops, with the fish tank feeding both. The fish-to-plant ratio determines how hard the nitrogen cycle has to work.

### beekeeping

**Post BEE-1** | `beekeeping` | ✅ existing circle image
A healthy honeybee colony at peak summer has 50,000 to 80,000 bees, a single laying queen producing up to 1,500 eggs per day, and enough foragers to visit 2 million flowers to produce a single pound of honey. The colony is not a collection of individuals doing simple tasks — it's a superorganism making collective decisions through pheromone communication, waggle dances, and quorum sensing. Understanding the colony's seasonal logic (build up in spring, swarm to reproduce, hunker down in winter, requeen when the old queen fails) is more useful for beekeeping than memorizing management techniques.

**Post BEE-2** | `beekeeping` | ✅ existing circle image
Varroa destructor mites are the primary reason honeybee colonies fail in most of the world today. The mite reproduces in capped brood cells, feeds on developing bees, and transmits viruses that weaken the colony over multiple brood cycles. A colony can look healthy for months while varroa populations build to a threshold that causes collapse. Monitoring mite levels with an alcohol wash or sugar roll every 4-6 weeks is the single most important management practice for keeping bees alive. Treatment thresholds, timing, and method depend on the season and the beekeeper's philosophy — but ignoring mite counts is how most new beekeepers lose their first colony.

### vermicomposting

**Post VC-1** | `vermicomposting` | ✅ existing circle image
Red wigglers (Eisenia fetida) are not soil earthworms — they're litter-dwelling species that live at the surface in decomposing organic matter rather than deep in mineral soil. This is why they thrive in a worm bin and die if you put them in a garden bed. They process organic material into castings that are richer in available nutrients than conventional compost — particularly in calcium, nitrogen, and beneficial microbial activity. A pound of red wigglers can process half a pound of food scraps per day. A healthy bin with 2 pounds of worms handles the food waste of a household of two people.

**Post VC-2** | `vermicomposting` | ✅ existing circle image
Worm castings work differently from fertilizer. They don't just supply nutrients — they supply a microbial community and humic acids that improve how nutrients are held and released in soil. In studies, plants grown in soil amended with castings show better germination rates, faster growth, and improved disease resistance compared to plants grown with equivalent synthetic fertilizer. The castings are building microbial infrastructure that outlasts any single application. A 10% casting amendment in potting mix is the standard recommendation; above 30%, some growers see diminishing returns as the biology shifts.

### fermentation

**Post FM-1** | `fermentation` | ✅ existing circle image
Wild lacto-fermentation — the kind that makes sauerkraut, kimchi, and naturally fermented pickles — uses only salt and time. The salt creates an environment hostile to pathogenic bacteria but hospitable to lactobacillus, which is already present on the vegetable surface. As lactobacillus ferments the sugars, it produces lactic acid, which drops the pH and preserves the food. No vinegar. No heat. No added cultures. The microbes doing the work are native to the vegetable and the fermentation environment. This is preservation without external inputs — the food preserves itself.

**Post FM-2** | `fermentation` | ✅ existing circle image
Sourdough is a managed ecosystem of wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria living in a flour-and-water paste. The yeast produces CO₂ (leavening) and flavor compounds; the bacteria produce lactic and acetic acids (sourness and shelf stability). The ratio between the two organisms, and between lactic and acetic acid, is controlled by hydration, temperature, and feeding schedule. A stiff, cold, infrequently fed starter favors more acetic acid (sharper, more vinegary). A loose, warm, frequently fed starter favors lactic acid (milder, more yogurt-like). The baker's job is managing the culture, not just baking the bread.

## LAND & COMMUNITY (remaining)

### agroforestry

**Post AF-1** | `agroforestry` | ✅ existing circle image
Silvopasture — integrating trees into pasture — is one of the most carbon-rich land uses available to farmers. Trees sequester carbon in wood, roots, and soil organic matter while producing timber, fruit, nuts, or fodder. Animals graze between the tree rows, their manure fertilizing the trees, and their browsing managing competing vegetation. Studies show silvopasture systems sequester 3-10 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per hectare per year — more than any other agricultural practice. The trees don't compete with the pasture in a well-designed system; they complete it.

**Post AF-2** | `agroforestry` | ✅ existing circle image
Alley cropping puts annual crops in the light corridors between rows of trees or shrubs. The trees provide wind protection, modify microclimate, and (if nitrogen-fixing species are chosen) contribute fertility through leaf litter and root exudates. The crops provide income and food during the years before the trees mature. The system transitions over decades: high annual production early, high perennial production later, without ever having a fallow or unproductive phase. The design challenge is choosing tree spacing, species, and orientation so that light competition becomes a feature — providing cool-season shade for heat-sensitive crops — rather than a limitation.

### holistic-grazing

**Post HG-1** | `holistic-grazing` | ✅ existing circle image
Allan Savory's insight about planned grazing was that livestock — when managed like wild herds — can be a restoration tool rather than a degradation tool. Wild grazers moved in dense, mobile herds driven by predator pressure. They grazed intensively and briefly in any one place, then moved on and didn't return for months. Their impact — hoof action, dung, urine, saliva on grazed plants — and the long recovery period that followed built the deep grassland soils that once covered a third of Earth's land surface. Managed holistic grazing attempts to replicate this pattern: high density, short duration, long rest.

**Post HG-2** | `holistic-grazing` | ✅ existing circle image
The recovery period is the most important and most neglected variable in grazing management. Conventional continuous grazing keeps animals on the same paddock indefinitely, selectively removing the plants they prefer and allowing less palatable species to dominate. Planned grazing gives each paddock a rest period long enough for grazed plants to fully regrow — typically 60 to 120 days depending on climate and season. During that rest, soil biology recovers, plant root reserves rebuild, and the next grazing impact lands on fully recovered vegetation. The number of paddocks in rotation determines how long each paddock rests. More paddocks, longer rest, better outcome.

## HEALTH & ECOLOGY (remaining)

### forest-bathing

**Post FB-1** | `forest-bathing` | ✅ existing circle image
The Japanese practice of shinrin-yoku — "forest bathing" — is now supported by a substantial body of research. Time spent in forested environments measurably lowers cortisol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate. It also increases natural killer cell activity — a component of immune function that is suppressed by chronic stress. The mechanism appears to involve phytoncides: volatile organic compounds released by trees, particularly conifers, that humans inhale passively during a forest walk. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to meditate or exercise. The forest does the work. Slow presence is the whole practice.

**Post FB-2** | `forest-bathing` | ✅ existing circle image
The difference between a walk in the woods and forest bathing is attention and time. Forest bathing is typically 2-4 hours in the same small area — not a hike to cover distance, but a slow, open-ended sensory presence in one place. Studies comparing 15-minute and 2-hour exposures show the longer duration produces significantly greater physiological effects. The practice asks you to use all senses, move slowly, and follow curiosity without destination or goal. In a culture organized around productivity and efficiency, that instruction is harder than it sounds. The difficulty is precisely the practice.

### open-source

**Post OS-1** | `open-source` | ✅ existing circle image
The Open Source Ecology project has developed open-source blueprints for 50 industrial machines — tractor, cement mixer, wind turbine, 3D printer, laser cutter, hydraulic press — designed to be buildable from commercially available parts for a fraction of their retail price. The Global Village Construction Set is the full kit: everything a small community needs to build a sustainable civilization from scratch. Every design is documented, shared freely, and improved collaboratively. This is what distributed manufacturing looks like — not Amazon delivering to your door, but communities building their own tools from shared knowledge.

**Post OS-2** | `open-source` | ✅ existing circle image
Open-source hardware documentation is most valuable when it captures not just the final design but the failure history. Why did version 1 break? What did version 2 change and why? What are the known limitations of version 3? This context — usually stripped out of finished product documentation — is the knowledge that lets the next builder improve rather than repeat. The best open-source hardware projects have detailed build logs, failure documentation, and community forums where problems are diagnosed publicly. The documentation is as much the product as the hardware.

### natural-swimming

**Post NS-1** | `natural-swimming` | ✅ existing circle image
A natural swimming pool works without chlorine by using a planted regeneration zone — typically 50% of the total water surface — filled with submerged and emergent aquatic plants whose roots and associated microbes filter and clarify the water biologically. The swimming zone stays clean because the water circulation draws it continuously through the plant zone. The system takes 2-3 seasons to establish biological maturity; in the first year, algae outcompetes the new plants and the water can be green. By year three, a well-designed natural pool runs clear throughout the swimming season with minimal intervention beyond plant management.

**Post NS-2** | `natural-swimming` | ✅ existing circle image
Natural swimming ponds have a fundamentally different relationship with ecology than chlorinated pools. A pool is a sterilized environment maintained by chemistry. A natural pond is a living system in dynamic balance — one that supports damselflies, frogs, water beetles, beneficial bacteria, and dozens of aquatic plant species while remaining safe and pleasant to swim in. Some natural bathers find the presence of this life reassuring rather than alarming. You are swimming in a functioning ecosystem, not a chemically treated container. The design challenge is achieving that balance; the reward is a body of water that gets better rather than requiring more chemicals over time.

### off-grid-tech

**Post OG-1** | `off-grid-tech` | ✅ existing circle image
The most resilient communication infrastructure for remote or disrupted communities is mesh networking — a system where each node relays traffic for its neighbors, so there's no single point of failure. Commercial internet requires centralized infrastructure that fails when power goes down, fiber is cut, or providers stop service. A local mesh network built from open-source hardware (Meshtastic LoRa devices, Raspberry Pi nodes, or commercial mesh routers flashed with open firmware) can maintain local communication indefinitely with solar power. It doesn't reach the internet, but it reaches your neighbors, and in a crisis, that's what matters.

**Post OG-2** | `off-grid-tech` | ✅ existing circle image
12V DC systems are more efficient for off-grid power than 120V/240V AC systems for most everyday loads. LED lighting, USB charging, water pumps, fans, and many tools run natively on 12V or 24V. Converting solar panel output to AC and then back to DC (which most electronics do internally) loses 15-20% of the energy to conversion inefficiency. A 12V native system skips that double conversion. The trade-off is that high-power loads (induction cooktops, power tools, workshop equipment) still need AC. Hybrid systems — DC for everyday loads, inverter for high-power tools — capture the efficiency of both approaches.

### Hemp Materials (North America)

**Post SRC-1** | `hempcrete` | ⏳ hold (hempcrete LoRA)
Sourcing hemp hurds (also called hemp shiv or hemp hurd) in North America has become dramatically easier since the 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp. The two most established suppliers for builder-grade hemp shiv are **Hempitecture** (Sun Valley, Idaho — ships nationwide, also sells pre-blended hempcrete binder) and **American Lime Technology** (Vancouver, BC / US distribution — also supplies the hydraulic lime). Both companies work directly with builders and can advise on mix ratios. If you're in the eastern US, smaller regional hemp processors have emerged since 2020; search the Hemp Industries Association directory for your nearest option.

**Post SRC-2** | `hempcrete` | ⏳ hold (hempcrete LoRA)
Hydraulic lime (NHL — Natural Hydraulic Lime) is what makes hempcrete set. Not agricultural lime. Not lime putty. Not hydrated lime. NHL is produced by burning impure limestone containing clay minerals; the result sets both by carbonation and hydraulic reaction with water, making it suitable for damp environments and structural applications. The two grades used in hempcrete are NHL 2 (softer, more flexible, better for insulation-grade mixes) and NHL 3.5 (stronger set, better for load-bearing applications). In the US, **American Lime Technology** distributes St. Astier NHL from France. In Europe, St. Astier and Lias-Franken are the dominant suppliers. Do not substitute Portland cement — it's incompatible with hempcrete's vapor management properties.

### Natural Plaster Materials

**Post SRC-3** | `natural-plasters` | ✅ existing circle image
Lime putty — the gold standard finish plaster material — is made by slaking quicklime in excess water and aging the resulting putty for months or years. The longer it ages, the smoother and more workable it becomes. Pre-bagged hydrated lime (what most hardware stores sell as "Type S lime") is a distant second — it works but lacks the plasticity and workability of well-aged putty. For finish plaster work, source aged lime putty if you can. **Limeworks.us** in the eastern US and **Mike Wye & Associates** in the UK are known for quality lime putty and will advise on specification for your application.

**Post SRC-4** | `natural-plasters` | ✅ existing circle image
For clay plaster, the most practical sourcing approach for most builders is test your site soil first. Dig down below topsoil, collect subsoil samples from several spots, and do a jar test: fill a jar with soil and water, shake, and let settle for 24 hours. The layers tell you your sand/silt/clay ratio. Clay-rich subsoil (deep red or orange layers common in much of the eastern US and Southwest) can be used directly in clay plaster with sand additions. If your site soil won't work, powdered clay in bags (available from pottery supply companies and some natural building suppliers) is the fallback. American Clay and Claylin are two US suppliers with builder-grade products.

### Seeds

**Post SRC-5** | `seed-saving` | ✅ existing circle image
For open-pollinated seed that you can actually save from, the most established sources in the US are **Seed Savers Exchange** (Decorah, Iowa — nonprofit with the largest heritage variety seed library in North America), **Fedco Seeds** (Maine — worker-owned cooperative, extensive OP catalog, excellent regional adaptation notes), and **Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds** (Missouri — large catalog, strong on unusual varieties). All three maintain and grow out their varieties rather than just reselling. When buying seed you plan to save, look for explicit "OP" or "heirloom" designation and avoid anything marked "F1" — those won't breed true.

**Post SRC-6** | `seed-saving` | ✅ existing circle image
Community seed libraries are a legal alternative to commercial seed companies for accessing locally adapted varieties. Most public libraries with a seed library will loan seeds from your region, often varieties that have been grown out and selected locally for years. You borrow, grow, save seed, and return the saved seed at the end of the season. The library's collection grows and improves over time through the combined selection work of hundreds of gardeners. The **Seed Library of Los Angeles**, the **Richmond Grows Seed Lending Library** in California, and hundreds of others operate this model. If your library doesn't have one, starting one costs almost nothing.

### Natural Building Education

**Post SRC-7** | `earth-building` | ✅ existing circle image
Learning natural building from a workshop beats learning it from a book in one specific way: you can't feel the right consistency of a cob mix from a description. Hands-on programs that offer short (3-7 day) intensives are accessible for most people without committing to full apprenticeships. Well-established programs in the US include **The Cob Cottage Company** (Cob Cottage Company, Oregon — foundational workshops since the 1990s), **The Canelo Project** (Arizona — straw bale and natural plaster focus), and **Aprovecho Research Center** (Oregon — rocket stoves and appropriate technology). Many regional programs also offer seasonal workshops; the Natural Building Network maintains a searchable directory.

**Post SRC-8** | `straw-bale` | ✅ existing circle image
The **Builders Without Borders** network and the **Straw Bale Association** in the UK both publish extensive free resources for straw bale construction — construction guides, engineering documentation, and regional practitioner directories. In the US, the California straw bale community has produced some of the best-documented permitted builds, and the code section (IRC Appendix S) that covers straw bale construction in several US states came from that documentation work. If you're getting a straw bale build permitted, California's experience is the most developed legal precedent to cite.

### Renewable Energy

**Post SRC-9** | `solar-electric` | ✅ existing circle image
**Solar Energy International (SEI)** in Paonia, Colorado has been training solar installers, off-grid system designers, and community energy educators since 1991. Their courses range from weekend workshops to professional certification tracks, and they offer online versions of most programs. SEI-trained installers are in every US state. If you're serious about designing and installing your own off-grid solar system — rather than just buying a pre-packaged kit — their "Solar Electric Design and Installation" course is the most practical technical training available in the US outside of a formal electrician apprenticeship.

**Post SRC-10** | `rocket-stove` | ✅ existing circle image
The **Aprovecho Research Center** in Cottage Grove, Oregon has been developing and testing efficient cookstove and heating designs since 1976. Their open-source rocket stove designs — freely downloadable from their website — have been built by millions of households across the developing world as clean-cooking technology. Their **Institutional Rocket Stove** design, developed for schools and community kitchens, can cook for 200 people on a fraction of the wood a conventional open fire would use. All designs are in the public domain. If you're building rocket mass heaters or cooking rockets, their combustion unit proportions and insulation specs are the most rigorously tested free reference available.

### Permaculture & Land Design

**Post SRC-11** | `permaculture` | ✅ existing circle image
The **Permaculture Research Institute** (PRI), founded by Geoff Lawton in Australia, has produced the most widely viewed free permaculture education content available — Lawton's Greening the Desert and Greening the Desert Revisited documentaries are the most-shared permaculture videos online. PRI's online permaculture design certificate (PDC) course is one of the most accessible and thorough online options. For in-person PDC programs, look for instructors who trained through IPEN (International Permaculture Education Network) — the certification process ensures a minimum curriculum standard. A PDC is the acknowledged baseline credential for permaculture design work.

**Post SRC-12** | `food-forest` | ✅ existing circle image
Martin Crawford's **Agroforestry Research Trust** in Devon, UK manages a 2-acre demonstration forest garden that is the most thoroughly documented food forest in the temperate world. His book "Creating a Forest Garden" is the most complete practical reference for temperate food forest design in English — species selection, guild design, establishment sequence, and long-term management. The trust runs open days and courses, and their species database is the best free reference for temperate food forest plants available. If you're designing a food forest in a temperate climate, Crawford's work is the starting point.

### Community Infrastructure

**Post SRC-13** | `tool-library` | ✅ existing circle image
The **Library of Things Association** (LOTA) supports tool libraries and libraries of things across North America and the UK with shared resources, insurance guidance, software recommendations, and a community of practice. Their website lists 200+ member libraries by location. Starting a tool library has a steeper legal and logistics curve than most community projects — insurance, check-out tracking, maintenance protocols — and LOTA's resources compress years of trial and error from existing libraries into accessible documentation. If you're starting a library from scratch, talking to an existing LOTA member library first is the highest-ROI first step.

**Post SRC-14** | `repair-culture` | ✅ existing circle image
**Repair Cafe International** provides free starter kits, guides, and a global map of existing repair cafes to anyone starting a new repair event. Their model is deliberately minimal: a recurring event in a public space, skilled volunteer repairers who give their time, and a simple tracking system that lets each cafe report how many items they've fixed versus the number that couldn't be repaired (the "repairability rate"). The global network now fixes over 100,000 items per month. Their data shows that about 70% of items brought in get repaired on the spot. The other 30% are mostly electronics with proprietary parts or unavailable documentation — which feeds directly into the right-to-repair policy argument.

### Water Systems

**Post SRC-15** | `rainwater-harvesting` | ✅ existing circle image
Brad Lancaster's **Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond** (3-volume series) is the most complete practical reference for both earthworks-based and tank-based water harvesting in print. Volume 1 covers principles and earthworks; Volume 2 covers roof catchment and tank systems; Volume 3 covers plants and integrated design. Lancaster's work is based on decades of implementation in Tucson, Arizona — one of the driest cities in North America — and is grounded in real measurable outcomes rather than theory. The series is available directly from his organization **Watershed Management Group**, which also runs free and low-cost workshops in the Tucson area and trains community water harvesters internationally.

## ADDENDUM — Hemp Blocks & Hempwood
*Added Session 22 (2026-02-25)*
*New build categories: hemp-blocks, hempwood*

---

### CIRCLE: hemp-blocks
*New circle — pre-cast and pre-pressed hempcrete block systems*

**Post HB-1** | `hemp-blocks` | 🔴 needs Flux image (hemp block stack)
The hempcrete block has arrived as a mainstream building product. Companies like **IsoHemp** (Belgium, 5 million blocks/year), **Cânhamor** (Portugal, ~300 houses/month capacity), and **Just BioFiber** (Canada) are producing pre-cast blocks at industrial scale — no formwork, no mixing on site. A typical IsoHemp block weighs about 7 lbs and takes 30 seconds to lay. The blocks click or stack into a timber frame exactly like conventional masonry, except they're carbon-negative, vapor-permeable, and achieve 2+ hour fire ratings. For self-builders who want hempcrete without the formwork and curing management, blocks are now a viable path in North America and Europe.

**Post HB-2** | `hemp-blocks` | 🔴 needs Flux image (interlocking block system)
The newest generation of hempcrete blocks uses interlocking frames — think Lego, but load-bearing and carbon-sequestering. **Just BioFiber**'s system uses a patent-pending polymer composite frame filled with hemp-lime core: each block sequesters approximately 6.5 kg of CO₂ and achieves zero smoke and flame spread rating in fire testing. Their manufacturing partner **Renewabuild** (Surrey, BC) runs at 2 blocks per minute. A US manufacturing facility through **Dakota Hemp** in South Dakota is expected to come online mid-2026 — the first interlocking hemp block manufacturer in the United States, co-located with a hemp processing facility.

**Post HB-3** | `hemp-blocks` | ✅ use existing hempcrete circle image
In the United States, **Lancaster Lime Works** (Pennsylvania) produces hemp blocks using lime-only binder — no Portland cement — available with matching H-1 binder and lime putty mortars for a fully lime-based wall system. **DTE Materials** (California) takes a different approach: their Stonefiber™ blocks replace the aggregate in standard CMU blocks with hemp and agricultural waste, achieving ASTM C90 structural ratings (600–2000 psi) while sequestering carbon. These two companies represent two distinct technical approaches: one is traditional hempcrete-in-block-form; the other is hemp aggregate in a conventional structural block form.

### CIRCLE: hempwood
*New circle — pressed hemp fiber for lumber replacement*

**Post HW-1** | `hempwood` | 🔴 needs Flux image (hemp lumber stack)
Hemp matures in 4–6 months. A hardwood tree takes 40–80 years. **Fibonacci LLC** (Murray, Kentucky) has been pressing hemp fibers into dimensional lumber since 2019 under the **HempWood®** brand — their product tests 20% harder than hickory with a Janka hardness over 2000. Right now HempWood is positioned for interior non-structural use: flooring, furniture, cabinetry, turning blanks. But the material science is ahead of the building codes: hemp fiber composite is stiffer per pound than most softwood lumber, and the structural rating pathway is being actively pursued.

**Post HW-2** | `hempwood` | 🔴 needs Flux image (hemp OSB/panel factory)
**Plantd Materials** (Durham, North Carolina) is building toward hemp-based structural panels using hemp as the fiber source in an OSB-like process. Their 4×8 sheets are already carbon-negative — sequestering roughly 80 lbs of CO₂ each — and they're developing structural wall and roof sheathing panels alongside a hemp 2×4 prototype. The company raised $22M and has ex-SpaceX engineers on their founding team. They're an XPrize contender in carbon-negative building materials. When structural hemp OSB clears testing, it changes the economic math on timber framing entirely.

**Post HW-3** | `hempwood` | ✅ use existing appropriate-tech circle image
The case for replacing dimensional lumber with hemp fiber composites is straightforward in theory: faster growth, higher CO₂ sequestration per acre, comparable or superior mechanical properties, and a manufacturing process that doesn't require the forest industry's land footprint. The obstacles are certification (building codes rely on tested, rated lumber species), supply chain (hemp fiber supply at industrial scale is still being built), and cost (early-run pressed hemp is premium-priced). The current state: flooring and interior applications are commercially available today. Structural panels are in prototype and certification phase. Load-rated structural hemp lumber is 3–5 years from broad availability. Worth watching closely.

### SOURCING GUIDE: Hemp Block Suppliers (North America + Europe)

**Post SRC-16** | `hemp-blocks` | ✅ use existing hempcrete circle image
Pre-cast hempcrete blocks are now available across North America without importing. **Lancaster Lime Works** (Pennsylvania) ships blocks with full lime-only binder systems — no Portland cement, consistent quality. **DTE Materials** (California) makes Stonefiber hemp aggregate CMU blocks rated to ASTM C90 structural standards. For interlocking systems, **Renewabuild** (British Columbia) manufactures the Just BioFiber block system; **Dakota Hemp** (South Dakota) is building the first US interlocking hemp block facility for 2026. In Colorado, **Hemp and Block** produces traditional pre-cast hempcrete blocks with all-USA materials. For Europe: **IsoHemp** (Belgium) distributes across 6+ EU countries; **Cânhamor** (Portugal) exports ECOblocks across the EU. The [International Hemp Building Association](https://internationalhempbuilding.org) directory lists current distributors by region.

### SOURCING GUIDE: Hempwood — Where to Buy

**Post SRC-17** | `hempwood` | ✅ use existing appropriate-tech circle image
For pressed hemp lumber products available now: **HempWood** (hempwood.com) sells direct — dimensional boards, flooring planks, turning blanks, picture frame stock. Products are positioned as high-end hardwood alternatives; pricing reflects the early-market premium. **Boardwurks Biocomposites** (Florida) offers HempBOARD panels and hybrid hemp composites (hemp-sugarcane, hemp-wheat bran) for interior panel applications. For structural panels in development: **Plantd Materials** is taking pre-orders and working with commercial builders on pilot projects — if you're a builder doing volume work, getting on their list now makes sense. Note: hempwood products are not currently rated for structural framing or load-bearing applications. Interior applications (flooring, cabinetry, furniture, millwork) are the right fit today.
