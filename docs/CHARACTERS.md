# Earthback Character Profiles

Twelve people. Twelve places. Each one has spent years — in some cases a lifetime — learning how to build with the ground beneath their feet. They are not spokespeople. They are practitioners.

*(Plus one specialist profile: Nadia Benali — hempcrete LoRA character, see bottom of file.)*

## James Osei
**Age:** 34 | **Location:** Accra region, Ghana

James grew up watching his uncle build houses out of red laterite blocks pressed by hand, the same way his grandfather did. He went to Kwame Nkrumah University, studied civil engineering, came back. Not because he had to — because he wanted to understand *why* the blocks cracked when they did, and how to stop it.

He runs a small compressed earth block operation on the eastern edge of Accra, where the laterite deposits are richest. Three workers, one semi-mechanized press, a drying yard that holds about 800 blocks at a time. He sells mostly to NGO housing projects and to private clients who've heard his blocks outlast fired brick in the wet season. His real ambition is a stabilization formula — low-cement, high-performance — that any builder in West Africa could afford to use.

He is lean, moves efficiently, talks fast when excited about material science and slowly when he's measuring something. He tests everything twice.

**What he works with:** Laterite, compressed earth blocks (CEB), low-cement stabilization
**What drives him:** Proving that traditional materials can outperform industrial ones on their own terms

## Lena Hartmann
**Age:** 31 | **Location:** Tafraoute, Anti-Atlas, Morocco

Lena came to Tafraoute on a research grant to document traditional Amazigh pisé construction before more of it disappears under concrete. She was supposed to stay six months. That was two years ago.

She's from Stuttgart, trained as an architect, writes rigidly technical German in her research notes and loose, warm observations in her personal journal. She has developed a close working relationship with a local master builder named Brahim who doesn't speak German or English and communicates almost entirely through demonstration. She has learned more from watching him work than from any academic source.

Her research has shifted from documentation toward intervention — she's now helping a local women's cooperative restore a section of their village's shared earthen wall, the one that keeps the winter wind off the market. She photographs everything, takes mortar samples, draws at night. She has a recurring argument with herself about whether outsiders can ever really understand vernacular architecture or whether understanding is beside the point.

She is careful, curious, a little serious. Gets quietly lit up when she finds something that doesn't match her models.

**What she works with:** Pisé (rammed earth), tabia, traditional Moroccan earthen mortars
**What drives her:** The gap between what's documented and what's actually known

## Tom Westhall
**Age:** 47 | **Location:** Willamette Valley, Oregon

Tom has been building with cob since before it was fashionable, back when you had to explain what it was to everyone including the permit office. He farms 40 acres, raises sheep, builds on weekends and in the shoulder seasons. He has put up seven cob structures on his property over twenty years — a workshop, a root cellar, a guest studio, and a small round house his daughter uses when she visits.

He doesn't do it for the aesthetics, though he has opinions about those too. He does it because he can fix anything that goes wrong with a bucket of mud and some straw, because the walls stay cool in summer without mechanical help, because he knows where every material came from. He teaches informal workshops on the property, charges a sliding scale, lets people stay in the round house when they need a place to think.

He has a deliberate, patient way of working — the kind that comes from doing physical things carefully for a very long time. He knows when to push and when to wait. He does not own a smartphone.

**What he works with:** Cob, lime plaster, straw bale, local clay
**What drives him:** Self-sufficiency; the satisfaction of a wall that will outlast him

## Rosa Mendez
**Age:** 38 | **Location:** Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica

The Osa Peninsula is one of the most biodiverse places on earth and one of the most difficult to build in — high humidity, heavy rainfall, termites, seismic activity, no easy access to industrial materials. Rosa has been working there for eight years, running a community housing cooperative that uses wattle-and-daub with bamboo structure and earthen plaster.

She grew up in San José, studied social work, moved to the Osa to help a cousin after a landslide took out part of their village. She learned to build out of necessity, then apprenticed herself to an older Boruca woman who knew the traditional methods. Now she teaches both. Her cooperative has built or repaired 34 homes.

She is the most organized person in any room, which is what it takes to coordinate volunteer labor, donated materials, and community buy-in all at once. She keeps a laminated card in her apron pocket with the clay-to-sand ratios for three different local soil types. She tests soils by rolling them between her palms and has opinions about what good clay feels like that she struggles to put into words.

**What she works with:** Wattle and daub, earthen plaster, bamboo hybrid structure
**What drives her:** Housing as a community act, not a commodity

## Mei Lin
**Age:** 29 | **Location:** Rural Mindanao, Philippines

Mei Lin came back to her home province after finishing an engineering degree in Manila and finding that most of what she'd studied had almost nothing to do with how people actually built things in Mindanao. She joined a small NGO focused on climate-resilient construction and has spent the last four years doing something harder than engineering school: convincing communities that local materials can be trusted.

She works mostly with earthen block construction reinforced with bamboo, adapted for typhoon resistance. She spends a lot of time on soil testing — taking auger samples, running field tests, mapping which villages sit on clay-rich soils worth using. She's methodical and patient in ways that don't come naturally to her and she's aware of that. She keeps a running checklist she revises constantly.

She is small, practical, tends to understate things. She speaks four languages and switches between them mid-conversation without noticing. When something doesn't work she takes it apart completely and starts over rather than patch it.

**What she works with:** Compressed earth block, bamboo reinforcement, soil analysis
**What drives her:** Making engineering useful to people who weren't in the room when it was invented

## Elena Vasquez
**Age:** 52 | **Location:** Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico

Acoma Pueblo has been continuously inhabited for over a thousand years. Elena has lived there her whole life, left once for four years for college, came back. She is not a builder by trade — she is a keeper of knowledge, which in Acoma means something specific and demanding.

She knows how to make traditional mica-flecked adobe plaster from memory, the way her aunt taught her, the way her aunt was taught. She knows the difference between the clay on the north side of the mesa and the south side and what each is good for. She has spent twenty years documenting this knowledge formally, working with the pueblo's cultural preservation office to create written and recorded archives of building practices that were never written down before.

She is also practical about what this knowledge needs to do: survive. She works with younger Acoma members who want to build, teaches them the traditional methods alongside enough structural understanding to work with modern permit requirements. She has a dry sense of humor about bureaucracy.

She is the kind of person who says very little until she has something worth saying, and then is precise.

**What she works with:** Adobe, traditional mica plaster, earthen repair and conservation
**What drives her:** Continuity — making sure this knowledge exists in hands, not just documents

## Amara Diallo
**Age:** 41 | **Location:** Thiès, Senegal

Amara is a master builder in the traditional sense — he learned by working, starting as a laborer at fourteen, becoming a foreman at twenty-four, taking on his first independent project at thirty. He builds primarily in banco, the West African earthen plaster and block system that has produced some of the most significant architecture on earth, including the great mosques of Mali.

He works out of Thiès but takes projects across Senegal and into southern Mauritania. He employs eight workers year-round, more during the dry building season. He has never drawn a formal plan — everything is in his head and in his hands. He has built mosques, schools, family compounds, and a regional health clinic that has stood for twelve years in excellent condition.

His English is limited but his French is precise and his Wolof is eloquent. He communicates with workers through demonstration and a few sharp words. He has a reputation for setting a standard and holding to it. He will stop a job and redo a wall section if it isn't right, and his workers know this and build accordingly.

**What he works with:** Banco, earthen block, traditional West African construction systems
**What drives him:** Craft — the standard of the work itself

## Marcus Webb
**Age:** 61 | **Location:** Eastern Kentucky

Marcus farms tobacco and timber on land his family has worked for four generations. He started building with stone and earth because he had stone and earth and no money, and he found he was good at it. That was thirty years ago. He has built a barn, a smokehouse, two outbuildings, and one small dwelling on his property using materials pulled from the land itself — fieldstone, clay subsoil, poplar timber from his own woods.

He is not ideological about any of this. He builds the way he builds because it works and because it's what he knows. He is suspicious of people who make earth building into a philosophy before they've figured out how to mix a decent mortar. He has a saying: *the wall will tell you if you're wrong.*

He is thick-shouldered and deliberate, talks in a low voice, does not use more words than necessary. He is one of the few people in his county who knows how to lay dry-stack stone well, and he has quietly taught half a dozen neighbors. He is sixty-one and in better physical condition than most men twenty years younger.

**What he works with:** Dry-stack stone, earthen mortar, cob, local timber
**What drives him:** Land knowledge — understanding a place well enough to build from it

## Kenji Nakamura
**Age:** 35 | **Location:** TU Delft, Netherlands

Kenji is a materials researcher at Delft's faculty of architecture, specializing in the mechanical and thermal behavior of earthen construction materials. He grew up in Kyoto, trained as a structural engineer, pivoted to earth materials when he became interested in why traditional Japanese earthen wall systems — kabe tsuchi — had performed so well in earthquake simulations compared to modern equivalents.

He is precise and methodical in the way that good lab scientists are — he distrusts anecdote and is careful about what he claims to know. He runs compression tests, moisture content studies, thermal mass simulations. He publishes in journals that builders rarely read, and this bothers him. He has been trying to write a practical guide for two years and keeps abandoning it because he isn't satisfied with how to make the uncertainty legible without being misleading.

He wears wire-rimmed glasses and tends to look at things for a long time before speaking. He drinks too much coffee. His desk is covered in labeled soil samples and he knows exactly where each one came from.

**What he works with:** Material testing, earthen construction analysis, thermal and structural modeling
**What drives him:** Closing the gap between research and practice

## Priya Sharma
**Age:** 44 | **Location:** Queensland, Australia

Priya runs her own architectural practice in Townsville, specializing in rammed earth residential construction for the North Queensland climate. She has been building with earth for fifteen years, after a formative experience on a research trip where she spent time with Aboriginal communities whose earthen building traditions are among the oldest in the world.

She describes herself as an interpreter — she takes what she learns from those traditions, from her own family's history of building in Tamil Nadu, from contemporary research, and from fifteen years of watching rammed earth walls perform in a subtropical environment, and translates it into buildings that people can actually live in.

She is direct and confident in client meetings, careful and questioning with contractors, fiercely protective of the material's reputation — she has turned down projects where she didn't think the budget would allow her to do it right. She has a waiting list.

**What she works with:** Rammed earth, earthen render, climate-responsive design
**What drives her:** Buildings that belong to their climate and their place

## Dara Okonkwo
**Age:** 33 | **Location:** Detroit, Michigan

Dara came to earth building through urban agriculture. She was running a community garden on a vacant lot in North End when she started thinking about what else could grow on land the city had written off. She took a cob workshop, then another, then spent a summer apprenticing with a builder in New Mexico. She came back to Detroit with a plan.

Her organization, Ground Work, builds small earthen structures on vacant urban lots — tool sheds, gathering spaces, a community kiln — using soil excavated from the lots themselves, which tend to be clay-rich urban fill. She works primarily with neighborhood teenagers and young adults, most of whom have never built anything before. She is less interested in the finished building than in what people become while making it.

She is warm and loud and has a gift for making things feel possible. She also has a spreadsheet for everything and follows up on every email. She has applied for eleven grants this year and received four.

**What she works with:** Cob, earthen brick, urban fill clay, community construction
**What drives her:** What happens to people when they build something with their hands

## Sam Torres
**Age:** 26 | **Location:** Phoenix, Arizona

Sam grew up watching his grandfather build adobe in Sonora, Mexico — slow, deliberate work, mud brick by mud brick, the kind of building that happened in the cool of early morning before the desert heat made everything impossible. He carries that memory like a compass.

He works construction in Phoenix — framing mostly, some finish work — and builds adobe on the side, weekends and days off, learning from an older Mexican-American builder named Arturo who has been doing it for forty years. Sam is the student and knows it. He asks a lot of questions, makes careful notes, sometimes disagrees respectfully.

He has started a small side business making adobe bricks to order, selling to restoration projects and homeowners who want to repair historic buildings. He is saving to buy a lot in Barrio Viejo where he wants to build his own house. He figures it will take him four years of weekends.

He is physically strong, good with his hands, a little quiet until he trusts someone. He has his grandfather's patience, which is the most useful thing he inherited.

**What he works with:** Adobe block, earthen mortar, traditional Sonoran building methods
**What drives him:** Continuity with his grandfather's knowledge; proving it still belongs here

## Nadia Benali *(Hempcrete LoRA character)*
**Age:** 43 | **Location:** Dordogne region, France / travels Europe

Nadia grew up between Casablanca and Lyon — her mother's family built with pisé in the Atlas foothills, her father's with concrete in suburban France. She trained as an architect in Bordeaux and spent a decade doing conventional residential work before she started asking why so many of her clients complained about the same things: summer overheating, winter drafts, air that felt dead. She took a hemp-lime workshop in 2009 on a friend's suggestion and hasn't worked with concrete since.

She now runs a small building crew and a training school out of the Dordogne, where the old farmhouses are thick-walled stone with lime mortar and the agricultural infrastructure exists to supply hemp shiv locally. She has built or overseen about sixty hempcrete projects — renovations, new builds, workshops, a school. She teaches weekend workshops that fill up two months in advance.

She is compact and precise, moves quickly around a job site. Her hands are permanently stained at the knuckles from lime and her forearms show the white residue of a day's work even after washing. She has a habit of picking up a handful of mixed hempcrete and squeezing it — the way it crumbles back apart tells her more than any formula.

**What she works with:** Hemp-lime (hempcrete), natural hydraulic lime, hemp shiv, lime plaster finishes
**What drives her:** The feeling of a wall — the warmth it holds, the air it breathes

**Trigger word:** `NADIA_BENALI_EB`
**Physical:** 43-year-old French-Moroccan woman, medium olive skin, dark brown eyes, short dark hair with early grey at the temples, compact build, strong forearms
**Seed:** 440001
