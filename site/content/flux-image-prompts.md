# Earthback — Flux Image Generation Prompts
*v1.0 · Feb 2026 · For use with Flux.1 [dev] or [schnell]*

---

## Notes on approach

These prompts are organized into three categories:
1. **Character portraits** — profile photos for each cast member
2. **Platform UI graphics** — feed illustrations, hero images, circle headers
3. **Game concept art** — post-apocalyptic world visuals

All prompts use the Earthback color palette as reference:
- Primary background tones: warm parchment, deep forest green, sun-bleached earth
- Accents: clay gold, moss green
- Avoid: sterile white, corporate blue, high-contrast tech aesthetics

For LoRA training: each character prompt below doubles as the visual brief for that character's training dataset. Aim for 15–20 training images per character: different lighting, angles, activities, but consistent face/age/build.

**Negative prompt (use for all):**
`cartoon, anime, illustration, painting, neon, oversaturated, studio backdrop, corporate headshot, plastic skin, AI-looking, symmetrical lighting, white background, glamour, makeup, filter`

solidly built, reading glasses pushed up, gray hair, skeptic's eyes that
have become a believer's. Standing beside a hempcrete wall he built
himself, Eastern Kentucky farmland behind him. Morning light, overcast.
Flannel shirt, work boots. The wall is clearly handmade — good but not
perfect. Documentary photography. Quiet pride without posing.
```

**Engineering meets mud shot:**
```
A 61-year-old white American man in reading glasses examining a hempcrete
wall with a rebound hammer — the tool of an engineer applied to an

A 31-year-old European woman foot-mixing cob — hemp fiber, clay soil, and
water — on a tarp on dry Moroccan earth. Anti-Atlas mountains in background,

slightly chaotic. Photojournalism.

## 2. PLATFORM UI GRAPHICS

### Hero image — landing page
```
Wide landscape photograph of a newly completed hempcrete home in a
transitional landscape — could be American Southwest, West Africa, or
Southeast Asia (ambiguous). Late golden hour light. Community members
visible outside, small figures to show scale. The home is beautiful —
clean lines, earthen walls, standing seam metal roof with solar panels.
It belongs to its landscape. Wide aspect ratio (16:9). Warm, cinematic,
real. No text overlays. Muted palette: deep green, clay gold, parchment.
```

### Feed page header — community feel
```
Overhead view of four or five pairs of hands around a hempcrete sample,
different skin tones, on a rough wooden table. Some hands are darker,
some lighter. The hempcrete block in the center. Tools, notebooks,
material samples at edges. Top-down, flat lay, documentary. Natural
light. Earthy tones. No faces. About hands and work and knowledge sharing.
```

### Circle header — Hemp Construction
```
Close-up of hemp fiber being packed into a timber formwork, hempcrete
construction in progress. Strong hands tamping the material. Late
afternoon light. The texture of hemp hurd is visible, warm golden color.
Shallow depth of field, soft background. Wide aspect ratio banner crop.
```

### Circle header — Bamboo Building
```
Looking up through a bamboo structural frame under construction — culms
and joints visible against a tropical sky, soft cloud cover. The geometry
is beautiful: organic but structural. Tropical light, green and gold.
Wide banner crop, aspect ratio 3:1.
```

### Circle header — 3D Construction Printing
```
Close-up of hempcrete being extruded from a construction printer nozzle,
the material landing in precise layers on the course below. Early morning
light in a desert workshop. The texture of each layer is visible, slightly
rough, organic. Industrial + natural. Wide banner crop.
```

### Circle header — Natural Building
```
A rammed earth wall in the final stages of construction — fresh earth
in the form, tamper marks visible, hands of two workers on either side.
Golden late afternoon light, West Africa or Southwest US (ambiguous).
The wall is the subject. Earth tones, clay red and brown. Wide banner crop.
```

## 3. GAME CONCEPT ART

### World overview — post-collapse landscape
```
Digital photograph style (not painting) of a post-collapse landscape at
golden hour — an overgrown highway visible in the distance, reclaimed
by vegetation. In the foreground: a newly built hempcrete community,
small but solid, with solar panels on standing seam roofs. Hemp fields
visible at the edge of the community. The contrast: collapse behind,
rebuilding in front. Cinematic wide shot, anamorphic lens distortion,
warm. Hopeful but honest.
```

### The Container Classroom in the field
```
A large shipping container repurposed as a mobile fabrication and
training unit, deployed in a West African landscape — red earth,
sparse trees, open sky. Its sides are open, revealing tools, material
samples, a small 3D printer inside. A group of people gathered outside
learning. Late afternoon light, dust in the air. Documentary / concept
art hybrid. Real-feeling, not fantasy.
```

### In-game build — hempcrete structure going up
```
A partially completed hempcrete structure being built by a group of
people in a post-collapse world — rough terrain, improvised tools,
handmade scaffolding. The building is progress: one wall complete and
solid, another just formwork. Golden hour. Cinematic. The vibe: this
matters, people are invested. Hyper-real photography style, not painted.
```

### Player character — survivor / builder archetype
```
A lone figure standing at the edge of a clearing in a post-collapse
landscape, back to camera, looking toward a half-built community in the
distance. They are carrying tools and a materials pack. The community
ahead has hempcrete walls, bamboo structures, solar panels, small fires.
Sunset. Cinematic wide shot. The figure is the player — no defined face
or ethnicity, could be anyone. Hope as a game mechanic.
```

## LoRA Training Notes

For consistent character art across the platform, train one LoRA per character in Flux.1 [dev].

**Training dataset per character:**
- 15–20 images, varied: head-and-shoulders, half-body, working, resting
- Consistent: age, build, skin tone, facial features
- Varied: lighting (golden hour, overcast, midday, interior), location, expression
- Captions: detailed, consistent trigger word per character (e.g., `TOM_WESTHALL_EB`)

**Suggested trigger word format:** `[NAME]_EB` (EB = Earthback)
- `TOM_WESTHALL_EB` — hemp farmer, Oregon, 47yo white male, weathered
- `JAMES_OSEI_EB` — trainer, Ghana, 34yo Ghanaian male, warm
- `ROSA_MENDEZ_EB` — architect, Costa Rica, 38yo Latina female
- `MEI_LIN_EB` — organizer, Philippines, 29yo Filipino female
- `ELENA_VASQUEZ_EB` — housing coordinator, NM, 52yo Native American female

**Priority order for LoRA training:**
1. James Osei — most active in platform narrative, game NPC
2. Lena Hartmann — bridge character, game + real world
3. Amara Diallo — highest visual/craft post frequency
4. Tom Westhall, Rosa Mendez — next most active in feed

*Platform profile photos should be 400×400px circular crop. Social card graphics: 1200×630px. In-game character art: whatever your engine needs.*
