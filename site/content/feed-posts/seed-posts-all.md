Hempcrete mix for a hard-frost climate. We run cold here October through April, so I've had to adjust the standard ratio. 4 parts hemp hurd : 1 part binder : 1.5 parts water is what I landed on after two failed test walls. The extra binder slows the cure but you get a denser block that doesn't crack when the ground heaves. Happy to share full notes. This is three seasons of trial.

Third harvest coming in. 38 acres of Bialobrzeskie this year, down two acres from last season — gave that corner over to a cover crop rotation. Stalks running tall, which is what I want for hurd volume. Retted for 14 days. Decorticator arrives Thursday. If the weather holds I'll have processed material in three weeks. Still the most satisfying part of the whole thing.

Cohort 12 just finished their first freestanding wall. Not a test panel — a real wall, load-bearing, on the housing project in Dodowa. Kwame Mensah, 22 years old, set the final block himself. Six weeks ago he had never touched hempcrete. That's what this is for.

We teach the jar test on day one. Fill a jar with soil from the site, add water, shake, let it settle overnight. Sand drops first, then silt, then clay floats on top. That layering tells you everything about your local mix potential and what binder ratio you'll need. No lab. No cost. Takes 24 hours. I've done this 60+ times and it still surprises me how different soils read.

Bamboo frame for the community center went up today. 18 meters span, no steel. The Guadua culms we treated last October — borax-boric acid, 21-day soak — are holding beautifully. The joints are pegged, not bolted. There is a moment when the frame becomes a building and the space inside becomes real. We had that moment this morning at about 11am.

Bamboo species selection quick guide for structural work in tropical climates. Guadua angustifolia: the gold standard, compressive strength rivals steel pound for pound, native to South America but cultivable in similar climates. Phyllostachys edulis (Moso): best for temperate zones, excellent for engineered panels and flooring. Dendrocalamus asper: Southeast Asia / tropics, huge culm diameter, good for large structural elements. Know your climate first, then your species. I can send a full comparison chart — just ask.

Land trust paperwork signed today. 12 families now hold title to the land their homes are being built on. The building is week 4 of 8. The ownership came first — that's not how it usually works and I think that's exactly why it usually doesn't work. The families are doing different work when they know they own the ground.

Bamboo community hall, week 3. The roof structure is up. It's the moment the space becomes real for people — before that it's poles and math, and then suddenly it's a place. We have 14 community members building full-time. Three of them have never done construction work before. I stopped keeping track of who's a "builder" and who's a "volunteer" because the distinction stopped meaning anything.

20 years of tribal housing notes. Not a formal document — just what I've watched work and not work. Federal programs: good money, bad timeline, usually gone before the second phase. Conventional contractors: rarely train locals, so skills leave with them. Natural building: the people who know this were here before any program existed. The knowledge didn't disappear — it was just undervalued. That's the thing Earthback gets right: it treats the existing knowledge as the foundation, not the obstacle.

First rammed earth wall poured on the new housing project. We used soil from 200 meters away. Tested it with the Pueblo's senior builder — she's been reading soil her whole life and she said it was good. That conversation, her hands in the dirt and her verdict, felt more important than any lab report. Three homes planned. The printer arrives next month for the second phase.

Soil testing in the field — no laboratory needed. Squeeze test: grab a handful of damp soil, squeeze hard, open your hand. Does it hold the shape cleanly? Good plasticity. Does it crumble? Too sandy. Ribbon test: roll the soil between your fingers into a ribbon. Can you get 5cm without it breaking? Good clay content for cob. Smell test: rich earth smell means good organic content — don't use for structural, use for plaster. These tests were taught to me in Marrakech. They were old when my teacher learned them.

Family compound build outside Thiès. Five structures, 100% local material. The soil came from the foundation excavation. The lime came from the kiln 8km away. The timber came from the woodlot on the same property. The closest thing from outside was the metal roofing — Spengler standing seam, 100-year guarantee. Every other material: zero transport miles. I have been building for 20 years and I am still surprised when it comes together like this.

What a structural engineer gets wrong about natural building, in order of how wrong I was. 1) "It won't be strong enough." Wrong — rammed earth compressive strength routinely exceeds 2MPa, more than adequate for residential. 2) "It won't hold up to moisture." Wrong if detailed properly — hempcrete is hygroscopic, it manages moisture rather than fighting it. 3) "You can't model it." Partially wrong — the performance envelope is less predictable than concrete, which is unsettling if you're used to tight tolerances. But I've built a wall now. It's fine.

Day 47 of the build. The hempcrete walls are fully cured — I've been testing hardness with a rebound hammer weekly and they plateaued right where the literature said they would. Solar array mounting went in today: 14 panels on the Spengler standing seam roof — the clips are designed for it, zero penetrations. Battery bank arrives Thursday. I did not expect to be the kind of person who builds their own house. Here I am.

6-month compression test results for mycelium composite panels: substrate mix A (hemp hurd + corn stover) hit 0.42MPa, substrate mix B (straw + wood chip) hit 0.31MPa. For context, conventional EPS foam is ~0.1–0.25MPa. Neither of these is structural — they're insulation and infill applications. But the performance is within range and the production process requires no petrochemicals and sequesters carbon during growth. Promising. Continuing to 12 months.

Pre-print dropped: "Growth substrate composition effects on Ganoderma mycelium composite mechanical properties." Co-authored with the TU Delft biomaterials group. Open access. The short version: hemp hurd substrate consistently outperforms others across density, compressive strength, and water resistance. Which I realize is not surprising to anyone in this community, but it's useful to have it in the literature now.

Sizing solar for an off-grid hempcrete home — the math that matters. Start with loads, not panels. A well-insulated hempcrete home with passive design in Queensland needs roughly 4–6kWh/day average. Work backwards: 6kWh ÷ 4.5 peak sun hours = 1.33kW array minimum, then multiply by 1.25 for system losses = ~1.7kW. Then battery: 3 days autonomy at 6kWh = 18kWh, 50% DoD means 36kWh battery bank. Most installers start with panels. Start with the building. The building is the biggest variable.

First fully off-grid natural building project complete in Queensland. Hempcrete walls, rammed earth floors, Spengler standing seam roof with clip-mounted 6.4kW solar, 28kWh LiFePO4 battery bank. Grid connection: zero. Projected annual energy bill: zero. The couple who live here are in their 70s and built most of it themselves with their adult kids. The grid hasn't touched this property in six months. That's the point.

Community land trust explainer for people new to the concept. A CLT removes land from the speculative market permanently. The community organization holds the land in perpetuity; residents own their homes on it with long-term ground leases. When they sell, resale price is controlled — they benefit, but not at the expense of the next buyer's affordability. The result: permanently affordable housing that can't be gentrified out of the community. It's not complicated. It's just different from how most people have been taught to think about ownership.

Three vacant lots in Detroit, six months in. Lot 1 is fully framed — straw bale walls going up, hempcrete infill starting next week. Lot 2 is foundation poured. Lot 3 is still in the land trust paperwork phase — city process. All three families have been part of the design process from the start. None of them have ever owned land before. The vacant lot across the street just sold to a developer for condos at $280k a unit. Our units will cost $85k to build and will be permanently affordable. That gap is the whole argument.

Clay-fiber mix calibration for the printer — what we learned after six failed test runs. The target is a consistency between peanut butter and cream cheese — thick enough to hold shape immediately after extrusion, fluid enough not to clog the head. Our problem: we were using fiber lengths that were right on paper but bridging in the hopper at humidity above 60%. Cut fiber length from 12mm to 8mm, added 2% bentonite to the binder, increased auger speed by 15%. Four clean runs since the change. Writing this up for the field manual.

First hempcrete wall off the Phoenix printer. Not perfect — there's a visible seam at about 40cm where we paused to troubleshoot a flow issue, and the corners are rougher than I want. But it's a wall. It's standing. It's hempcrete we mixed ourselves from Oregon hurd. The print took 4.5 hours for a 3.2m x 2.4m section. Conventional form-and-pour would have taken two days with a crew. We have a lot to learn still but I can see what this becomes.

First real cob wall. It looks nothing like the game. In the game the texture is perfect and it cures in one in-game hour. In real life my wall looks like a lumpy sand sculpture and I've been waiting three weeks. I did everything right according to @amara.diallo's technique posts — fiber length, water content, foot mixing. The test wall is solid. Doesn't crumble. Passed the rain we had Tuesday. I just didn't expect to care this much about a pile of mud.

Finished a small room. 3m x 4m. 100% local earth — soil from the site, straw from the farm down the road, lime plaster from the market in town. Took me six weeks, working most days, mostly alone. Cost about 200 euros in materials. It's not beautiful by any professional standard. It is solid and dry and warm at night when the desert cools down. In the game I built a fortress in this time. In real life I built one small room and I think it might have been harder.
