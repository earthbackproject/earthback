Ten years ago I was building 3D printers.

Not desktop printers — large-format fabrication systems. I was Chief Production Engineer at Spengler Industries, where we manufacture metal roofing systems, and I'd become obsessed with the question of what you could build if you gave a community the right tools and the right materials.

The answer I kept coming back to was: almost anything.

That obsession became the Earthback Project.

Earthback is a construction technology and community platform built around a simple premise: 1.8 billion people lack adequate housing, and the conventional construction industry — dependent on global supply chains, expensive materials, and specialized labor — cannot solve that at scale. But communities can, when they have the tools and the knowledge.

The technology at the center of it is a 3D construction printer I designed — a general-purpose fabrication system that can print hempcrete, concrete, bamboo-fiber composite, and rammed earth structures in days rather than months. It's not a printer for one material. It's a platform for whatever the land grows.

But the technology is the least interesting part.

What Earthback is really about is the container classroom — a deployable unit that lands in a community with no building knowledge and leaves with farmers who can process their own materials, builders who can raise their own structures, and a community that owns the skills permanently. Technology optional. Human knowledge mandatory.

We're building three linked organizations:

Earthback Foundation — social impact, grants, education, tribal and rural partnerships.
Earthback Alliance — partner coordination, supply chain development, workforce training.
Earthback Project — technology development, platform, 3D printing systems.

And a community platform launching in 2026 — a place for the hemp farmers, bamboo builders, rammed earth specialists, solar integrators, and community land organizers who are actually doing this work, all over the world, to share what they know.

At Spengler Industries, the metal roofing systems we produce are part of the Earthback build — 100-year standing seam roofs with integrated solar, zero penetrations, designed to last longer than most of us will be around to see.

The 3D printer work led here. The metal roofing work feeds it. The mission is what connects them.

If your work touches natural building, community housing, tribal land development, sustainable agriculture, hemp supply chain, or renewable energy integration — I'd like to talk.

## EXPERIENCE

### Current Role 1
```
Title:     Founder & Inventor
Company:   Earthback Project
Duration:  2024 – Present
Location:  Pacific Northwest

Building a construction technology and community platform for natural material building — hemp, bamboo, rammed earth, mycelium, mass timber. Inventor of the Earthback 3D construction printer, a general-purpose fabrication system for community-scale natural building. Developing the Earthback Alliance partner network and launching the community platform in 2026.

Key work:
— Designed and built prototype 3D construction printing system
— Developed multi-material print workflow for hempcrete, concrete, and bamboo-fiber composite
— Established three-organization structure (Foundation, Alliance, Project)
— Building pre-launch community platform and Alliance partner network
```

### Current Role 2
```
Title:     Chief Production Engineer
Company:   Spengler Industries
Duration:  [start year] – Present
Location:  Pacific Northwest

Leading production engineering for Spengler Industries, manufacturer of standing seam metal roofing systems. The Spengler standing seam roof system is a core component of the Earthback build — 100-year lifespan, clip-mounted solar integration with zero penetrations, designed for permanent off-grid residential and community structures.

### Previous Role (3D Printer work)
```
Title:     [Your title — if same company use as earlier period at Spengler, or separate entry]
Duration:  ~2012 – 2020 (adjust to actual dates)

Large-format fabrication system development. Designed and built custom 3D printing and fabrication equipment. This work became the technical foundation for the Earthback construction printer.

## CONNECTION REQUEST / MESSAGE TEMPLATE
*Use when connecting with potential Alliance partners*

```
Hi [Name] —

I'm Nicco Macintyre, founder of the Earthback Project — a construction technology and community platform for natural material building (hemp, bamboo, rammed earth). We're building the Earthback Alliance, a network of organizations in sustainable construction, community development, and agricultural supply chains.

Given [their organization]'s work in [relevant area], I think there's a real alignment worth a conversation.

Would you be open to a call?

— Nicco

## BANNER IMAGE RECOMMENDATION
Use the Earthback brand — deep green (#1F3A2E) with "the EARTHBACK PROJECT" in Cormorant Garamond, clay gold accent. Or a site photo of a completed natural building with good light. I can generate this with Flux once the brand assets are finalized.

## PROFILE PHOTO
Professional but not corporate. Natural light, outdoor or workshop setting if possible. You don't need a suit — the 3D printer / construction background means practical and capable reads better than formal.
