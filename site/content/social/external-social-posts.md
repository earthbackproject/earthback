## Pillar 1 — Education (standalone posts)

---

**EB-TW-001**
```
Hemp grows 4 meters tall in 4 months.

It's fire resistant.
It stores carbon as it cures.
It breathes — regulates humidity without mechanical systems.

You can build a wall with it.

1.8 billion people need housing.

These facts are related.
```
*CTA: Join the waitlist → [link]*

**EB-TW-002**
```
Bamboo has a higher tensile strength-to-weight ratio than steel.

It grows to harvestable size in 3–5 years.
A bamboo grove sequesters 3x more carbon than equivalent timber.
It grows on every continent except Antarctica.

We've been building with it for 5,000 years.
We kind of forgot.
```
*CTA: none — pure education, earn the follow*

---

**EB-TW-003**
```
Rammed earth walls:

— Made from soil dug on site
— Zero transport miles
— Compressive strength exceeds most residential concrete requirements
— Naturally fire resistant
— Thermally massive — warm in winter, cool in summer
— 3,000 year track record

The "new" materials aren't always new.
```

---

**EB-TW-004**
```
The global housing math:

1.8B people without adequate housing now.
3B expected by 2030.
96,000 new homes needed every single day.

Conventional construction can't do it.
The supply chains don't exist.
The materials cost too much.
The skills aren't there.

There's another way.
```
*CTA: We're building it → [link]*

---

**EB-TW-005**
```
A hempcrete wall doesn't burn.

Test it yourself: hold a flame to a sample. It chars. It doesn't ignite.

In a world of increasing wildfire this matters more than almost anything else in residential construction.

And it's made from a plant you can grow in four months.
```

---

**EB-TW-006**
```
Mycelium — fungal root networks — can be grown into structural panels.

Feed them hemp hurd or straw.
They bind it together as they grow.
Kill the growth. You have a rigid, lightweight, fire-resistant composite.

No petrochemicals.
Carbon stored during production.
Completely biodegradable at end of life.

Fungi are going to replace a lot of foam insulation.
```

---

## Pillar 2 — Vision / Mission

---

**EB-TW-007**
```
The only supply chain that can't be disrupted is the one that grows in your community.

Hemp: 4 months.
Bamboo: 3 years.
Timber: 20–40 years (managed).

The further out you plant, the more resilient you become.
```

---

**EB-TW-008**
```
Every technology we use can be replaced by conventional tools and human skill.

We teach manual building first.

Because real resilience doesn't come from machines.
It comes from people who know how to build.
```

---

**EB-TW-009**
```
What happens when a community grows its own building materials?

It owns its housing costs.
It owns the skills.
It owns the land.

Dependency ends when the supply chain starts in your own field.
```

---

**EB-TW-010**
```
96,000 homes per day.

Not 96,000 identical units shipped from a factory.

96,000 homes built by communities that own the skills, the materials, and the land.

That's the difference between a housing program and a housing transformation.
```

## Pillar 3 — Community / Platform teasers

---

**EB-TW-011**
```
There are people right now:

— testing hempcrete mix ratios in Oregon
— training build cohorts in Ghana
— designing bamboo community centers in Costa Rica
— organizing land trusts in Detroit
— researching mycelium composites in the Netherlands

They're going to be in one place soon.

```

---

**EB-TW-012**
```
We're building a platform for the people actually doing this.

Not a theory forum.
Not a blog.

A place where a hemp farmer in Oregon and a builder in Senegal
are in the same conversation.

Coming soon. Join the waitlist → [link]
```

---

## Pillar 4 — Game teasers

---

**EB-TW-013**
```
What if the skills you needed to survive a collapse
were the same skills needed to fix things before one happens?

We're building that world.

Both of them.
```

---

**EB-TW-014**
```
Post-collapse survival tip:

Learn to read soil with your hands.
Squeeze test. Ribbon test. Smell test.

This works in the game.
It also works in real life.

Both are coming.
```

## Thread — The Container Classroom (5 posts)

*Post as a thread, 1–2 days apart, or as one threaded post*

---

**EB-TW-THREAD-01**
```
A shipping container lands in a community that has never built with natural materials.

8 weeks later they've trained farmers, processed materials, and built their first structure.

Here's how it works 🧵
```

---

**EB-TW-THREAD-02**
```
Week 1–2: Soil and material assessment.

What grows here? What's in the ground?

Hemp in temperate climates. Bamboo in the tropics. Rammed earth almost anywhere.

The container carries the tools. The material comes from the land.
```

---

**EB-TW-THREAD-03**
```
Week 3–4: Processing and mixing.

Hemp stalks retted and decorticated — fiber separated from hurd.
Hurd mixed with lime binder and water.

The container is a mobile processing facility.
Everything needed to turn raw crop into building material.
```

---

**EB-TW-THREAD-04**
```
Week 5–8: Building.

Forms. Walls. Roof. Integration with solar and metal roofing systems.

The community doesn't just watch.
They build.
The skills stay when the container leaves.

That's the whole point.
```

---

**EB-TW-THREAD-05**
```
The container moves on.

The building stays.
The knowledge stays.
The community owns both.

No dependency. No recurring cost. No outside contractor required next time.

This is what we mean by transformation, not assistance.

```
This is hempcrete before it becomes a wall.

Hemp hurd — the woody core of the stalk — mixed with lime and water.
It cures harder over time. It doesn't burn.
It stores the carbon that grew it.

Four months from seed to building material.

*Visual: bamboo structural frame against tropical sky*
```
No steel. 18 meter span. Costa Rica.

Guadua bamboo, treated with borax-boric acid, pegged joints.

The frame went up in a day.
The community built it.
They'll maintain it forever because they know how.

*Visual: rammed earth wall, close-up showing layers and texture*
```
Every layer in a rammed earth wall is a day's work.

Soil from the site.
Compressed in lifts.
Solid as concrete when it's done.

Zero transport miles.
3,000 year track record.

*Visual: solar panels on standing seam metal roof, blue sky*
```
Zero penetrations.
Clip-mounted to standing seam.
Grid connection: none.

A hempcrete home with a 100-year roof and a lifetime of free energy.

This is what off-grid looks like when it's done right.

The most important thing we build isn't the wall.

It's the knowledge that stays when we leave.

Grown, not manufactured.

Mycelium composite panels: fungal networks grown through hemp hurd or straw.
Fire resistant. Carbon storing. No petrochemicals.

The future of insulation is alive.

*Visual: vacant Detroit lot with straw bale framing going up*
```
Three vacant lots in Detroit.

Six months from empty ground to community-owned homes.

Straw bale walls. Land trust ownership. Permanently affordable.

The gap between a $280k condo and an $85k community-built home
is a policy choice.

were the same skills rebuilding the world right now?

We're building both worlds.

The game comes first.
Then you find out it's real.

The housing crisis is not a shortage of money.

It's a shortage of local capacity.

1.8 billion people lack adequate housing. The conventional construction industry — dependent on global supply chains, specialized labor, and expensive materials — cannot solve this at scale.

But communities can, when given the right tools and knowledge.

The Earthback Project is building the infrastructure for community-led construction using natural materials: hemp, bamboo, rammed earth, mycelium composites, mass timber. Materials that can be grown or sourced within 50 miles of almost any building site on earth.

Our approach: deploy a mobile container classroom that trains farmers, processes materials, and builds structures — leaving communities with the skills and tools to keep building independently.

We're pre-launch. If your organization works in community development, affordable housing, tribal housing, or sustainable construction, we'd like to talk.

Why hemp for construction?

In 4 months, an acre of industrial hemp produces enough fiber and hurd to build approximately 500 square feet of hempcrete wall — fire resistant, carbon storing, breathable, and durable for centuries.

The same acre that grew food crops last year. The same farmers. The same land.

The processing infrastructure is the missing link. The Earthback Alliance is building it — mobile, deployable, community-operated.

If you're in agricultural development, rural economic development, or tribal land management: this is relevant to you.

For organizations working in tribal housing:

We've been in conversation with housing coordinators across the American Southwest and Pacific Northwest. The consistent feedback: federal programs bring money and take skills. Conventional contractors build and leave. The community is no better equipped to solve its housing problem than it was before.

The Earthback approach is different by design. We train community members first. We source materials locally first. The technology is optional — every home can be built with conventional tools. We teach manual construction because real resilience comes from people, not machines.

If you're working in tribal housing development, we're building something worth knowing about.

We're looking for Alliance Partners.

The Earthback Alliance connects hemp co-ops, bamboo processors, sustainable timber operations, solar installers, natural building contractors, and community developers into a shared supply chain and referral network.

Partners get:
— Listing in the Alliance directory (searchable by project coordinators globally)
— Access to the community platform pre-launch
— Alliance partner badge and network visibility
— Collaboration on deployment projects in your region

We're building the network now, before the platform launches.

If your organization belongs in this ecosystem, reach out.

The 3D construction printer isn't the point.

We lead with it because it's interesting, and it's real — a layer-free monolithic construction system that can print hempcrete, concrete, bamboo-fiber composite, and rammed earth structures in days instead of months.

But the technology is optional.

Every home in the Earthback system can be built entirely with conventional tools and manual labor. We teach that first. Always.

Because in a power outage, in a supply chain disruption, in the aftermath of a disaster — the community that knows how to build with their hands is the community that survives.

The printer accelerates. The skills endure.

If you've ever wanted to build with natural materials but didn't know where to start —

We're building a platform for exactly this. A community of hemp farmers, bamboo builders, rammed earth specialists, solar integrators, and community land organizers from around the world.

People who are doing this work right now, sharing what they know.

We're pre-launch and building out the community. If this is your world — or you want it to be — join the waitlist at earthbackproject.org.

For anyone in the natural building community:

Quick guide to hempcrete mix ratios by climate zone.

Cold climates (frost risk): 4 parts hemp hurd : 1 part lime binder : 1.5 parts water. Extra binder slows cure but prevents cracking when ground heaves.

Temperate climates: 4 parts hurd : 1 part binder : 1.2 parts water. Standard ratio, good performance.

Hot arid climates: 3.5 parts hurd : 1 part binder : 1 part water. Less water, faster cure, watch for surface cracking.

Hot humid climates: 4 parts hurd : 1.2 parts binder : 1.1 parts water. Slightly more binder helps in high humidity curing conditions.

These are starting points — local materials vary. Always run test blocks first.

Save this. Share it with someone building with hemp.
```

**EB-FB-003**
```
Launching soon: a community platform for natural builders, hemp farmers, bamboo architects, solar integrators, and community land organizers.

Not a Facebook group. A dedicated space with post types, circles by topic and region, project tracking, and a resource library.

Built for the people doing this work — not for people talking about it.
