Some of you know I've been working on something for a while. I haven't talked about it much because I wanted to get it far enough along before I did.

Here's the short version:

I've spent the last ten years building things — metal roofing systems at Spengler, 3D printers before that. A few years ago those two threads came together into something bigger.

The Earthback Project is a construction technology platform built around natural materials — hemp, bamboo, rammed earth — and a 3D printer I designed that can build homes in days from materials a community can grow themselves.

The problem it's trying to solve: 1.8 billion people without adequate housing. A global construction industry that can't reach them. A different way that actually can.

We're launching a community platform in 2026 — a place for the builders, farmers, and organizers around the world who are actually doing this work to share what they know. There's also a game side that I'll tell you more about soon.

I'm not great at talking about things before they're ready. This is ready enough.

If you want to follow along: earthbackproject.org — you can join the waitlist there.

And if anyone has connections in natural building, community land development, hemp farming, tribal housing, or sustainable construction anywhere in the world — I'd genuinely love an introduction.

More soon.

Been building something quietly for a few years.

Natural material construction + a 3D printer I designed + a community platform for the people doing this work globally.

Earthback Project. Pre-launch 2026.

More here if you want the longer version 👇

```
The short version of why:

1.8B people without adequate housing.
Hemp grows to 4m in 4 months, is fire resistant, stores carbon.
A community can grow its own building materials.

The printer makes it fast.
The knowledge makes it permanent.

That's Earthback.

Welcome to the Earthback Project.

We're building a platform for a global community of natural builders — hemp farmers, bamboo architects, rammed earth specialists, solar integrators, and community land organizers who are solving the housing crisis from the ground up.

1.8 billion people lack adequate housing. Conventional construction can't reach them at scale. Natural materials — hemp, bamboo, rammed earth, mycelium — grown and sourced locally can.

We're pre-launch. The community platform opens in 2026.

If this is your world — or you want it to be — follow this page and join the waitlist at earthbackproject.org.

We'll be sharing:
— What natural building actually looks like in practice, from builders around the world
— The materials: how they work, why they matter, what they can do
— The technology: a 3D construction printer designed to build homes from locally grown materials
— The community: the people doing this work right now

Welcome. More soon.

The Earthback Project is a natural material construction platform.

Hemp. Bamboo. Rammed earth. Mycelium.

Materials communities can grow themselves.
A 3D printer that builds homes in days.
A platform for the people doing this work globally.

Pre-launch 2026. 🌱

earthbackproject.org

Why Bluesky?

Because the people rebuilding the world — natural builders, community land organizers, hemp farmers, off-grid designers — tend to end up here.

We're building a community for exactly those people.

Follow along. More soon.
