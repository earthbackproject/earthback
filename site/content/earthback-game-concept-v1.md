# Earthback — Game Concept v0.1
*Feedback draft · Feb 2026 · For Rust players*

---

## The Short Version

Survival / builder in a post-collapse world. Rust DNA but no forced wipe. What you build persists and ages. Communities grow over months. Skills compound. The materials you use are real — hempcrete, bamboo, rammed earth, mycelium composites — and they behave like they do in real life (fire-resistant walls, breathable interiors, living structures that need maintenance). There's a real-world platform running in parallel where people are actually building with these materials.

## The World

Climate collapse + infrastructure failure. Governments are gone or irrelevant. Supply chains are dead. You can't order materials — you have to grow them, find them, or trade for them. The grid is down; solar is rare and valuable. Concrete is expensive to produce without industry. The communities that figured out local materials are the ones that survived.

You start with nothing in a procedurally generated region. So does everyone else.

## How It's Different from Rust

| Rust | Earthback |
|------|-----------|
| Monthly forced wipe resets everything | No forced wipe — world persists and evolves |
| Blueprint progression resets | Skills stay with your character permanently |
| Materials: wood → stone → metal | Materials: salvage → earthen → grown → composite |
| Server pop = server politics | Community-building is mechanically incentivized |
| Chaos loop | Recovery arc |

**The wipe problem:** Rust wipes to reset power dynamics and prevent server bloat. We solve this differently. Instead of wiping, the world evolves — seasonal storms damage structures that aren't maintained, new collapse events open new regions, and aging infrastructure creates constant low-grade challenge without resetting everything you've built. Power dynamics shift through conflict, trade, and politics, not an admin clicking "reset."

## Core Mechanics

### Materials Ladder
Not a tier system — a **regional system**. What you can build depends on what grows or exists where you are.

- **Salvage** — Early game. Scrap metal, reclaimed lumber, broken concrete. Fast to build, poor insulation, degrades.
- **Earthen** (rammed earth, cob, adobe) — Mid game. Slow to build, very durable, locally available almost anywhere. Fire resistant.
- **Grown** (hemp, bamboo, straw, timber) — Requires cultivation or trade. Hempcrete is fire-resistant, carbon-storing, and breathable. Bamboo is fast-growing and structurally strong. Straw bale is excellent insulation.
- **Composite** (mycelium panels, bamboo-fiber reinforced concrete) — Late game. Requires research, specific tools, community-scale production.
- **3D-printed** — Requires the Fabricator (see below). Unlocks custom architectural elements and rapid construction at scale.

Material properties matter: a hempcrete wall won't burn. A bamboo structure needs treatment or it degrades in wet climates. Rammed earth is rock-solid in arid zones and vulnerable to water without proper design.

### Skills (No Reset)
Skills are earned through doing, not through blueprint drops. Build 50 rammed earth walls and you understand rammed earth. Skills don't disappear when you die — your character carries them. This means veteran players are genuinely more capable, not just better geared.

Skill trees roughly follow the real Earthback circles:
- **Cultivation** (hemp, bamboo, food systems)
- **Earthen Construction** (cob, rammed earth, adobe)
- **Grown Materials** (processing, hempcrete mixing, bamboo treatment)
- **Fabrication** (3D printing, composite production)
- **Energy** (solar, battery storage, off-grid systems)
- **Community** (land coordination, training, mutual aid — passive buffs to group productivity)

### The Fabricator (Container Classroom)
A deployable unit — roughly the size of a shipping container — that unlocks advanced construction and training capabilities. It takes significant resources to build or acquire. Communities that have one can:
- 3D-print structural elements and custom components
- Run training sessions that accelerate skill gain for all nearby players
- Process materials at scale (hempcrete mixing, bamboo treatment)

It's a strategic asset, not personal gear. You defend it. You share it. You move it when you need to establish a new outpost.

### World Events (The Anti-Wipe)
Instead of server wipes, the world gets harder and more interesting over time:
- **Seasonal storms** — structural damage to poorly-maintained buildings. Incentivizes maintenance and community.
- **Collapse events** — new regions open as infrastructure fails elsewhere. Fresh starts available without losing your base.
- **Resource pressure** — certain materials cycle in scarcity. Drives trade, conflict, and cooperation.
- **Rival factions** — NPC and player factions compete for territory and resources. Politics, not just fighting.

No admin reset. The world changes; it doesn't disappear.

## The Two Versions

**Post-Apocalyptic (game):** Everything above. Survival, community building, material science as gameplay.

**Real World (platform):** The same community platform where actual builders, farmers, and housing organizers share what they're doing. Same materials, same skills, real stakes. Players who get deep into the game and want to know if hempcrete is actually fire-resistant — it is, and there are people on the platform who've tested it.

The two worlds aren't separate products. They're the same community seen from two angles.

## Big Open Questions (Looking for Feedback)

1. **PvP model** — Full loot like Rust, or softer? The philosophy skews toward cooperation but conflict is what makes survival games interesting. How do you keep it tense without making it purely adversarial?

2. **Server size / world scale** — Rust servers run 100–500 players. Does this concept want smaller, more community-focused servers (50–100) or does scale matter?

3. **The no-wipe tension** — Rust players are addicted to the fresh start. Is the collapse event / new region mechanic enough to scratch that itch, or does it feel like a workaround?

4. **What breaks this?** — What's the thing you'd see in a server like this that would make you quit after a week?

5. **Platform crossover** — Does the real-world community side feel interesting or irrelevant to you as a player?
